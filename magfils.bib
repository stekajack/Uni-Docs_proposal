	Abstract = {The behaviour of magnetotactic bacteria in an AC magnetic field is studied both theoretically and experimentally. The role of thermal fluctuations is studied by simulating the Brownian dynamics. The origin of the magnetic moment coupling to the body of bacterium is studied and it is shown that besides the coupling due to the magnetodipolar interaction of magnetosomes the contribution due to the flexibility of cytoskeletal proteins may be important. The behaviour of magnetotactic bacteria is studied experimentally in rotating and AC magnetic fields. The magnetic moment of bacterium is determined by measuring its retardation angle in a rotating field. It is illustrated experimentally that magnetotactic bacteria in an AC magnetic field orient themselves perpendicularly to the field lines as predicted by the theoretical model. Experimental results on the magnetotactic bacteria behaviour in the AC field are described quantitatively using a model, which considers the action of a small steady field, and the strength of the magnetic moment coupling to the body of bacterium is determined.

These elongated bacteria are propelled by single flagella at each bacterial end and contain a magnetic filament formed by a linear assembly of ∼40 ferromagnetic nanoparticles. The movements of the bacteria in suspension are analyzed by consideration of the orientation of their magnetic dipoles in the field, the hydrodynamic resistance of the bacteria, and the propulsive force of the flagella. Several novel features found in experiments include a velocity reversal during motion in the rotating field and an interesting diffusive wandering of the trajectory curvature centers. A new method to measure the magnetic moment of an individual bacterium is proposed based on the theory developed.},

	Abstract = {Fluids of spherical colloids possessing an off-centered embedded magnetic dipole were investigated by using Monte Carlo simulations. Systems of colloids with different strengths and directions of the embedded dipole moment confined in a 2D space without and with an external magnetic field applied were considered. The fluids were characterized by radial distribution functions{,} angular distribution functions{,} cluster data{,} and energetic data. In the absence of an external field{,} the colloids form dimers and trimers at sufficiently large magnetic moment without the tendency of forming chains of colloids as appearing in systems with particles possessing a central magnetic dipole. In the presence of an external field{,} chains of colloids aligned in a zigzag fashion were formed for a field parallel to the plane of the particles{,} whereas the colloidal ordering was suppressed in the presence of a field perpendicular to that plane. The findings agree surprisingly well with the recent experimental observations on fluids containing spherical polymer colloids with embedded single-domain magnetic hematite cubes (S. Sacanna{,} L. Rossi{,} and D. J. Pine{,} J. Am. Chem. Soc.{,} 2012{,} 134{,} 6112).},

	Abstract = {Tailoring the structure of nanocrystal superlattices is an important step toward controlled design of novel nanostructured materials and devices. We demonstrate how the long-range order and macroscopic dimensions of magnetic nanoparticle arrays can be controlled by the use of a modulated magnetic field. Inducing a dipolar attraction during the initial stage of the drying-mediated self-assembly process was sufficient to assemble the superparamagnetic oleate-capped maghemite nanocubes into large and defect-free superstructures with both translational and orientational order. The characteristic dimensions of the superlattice are controlled by the particle concentration as well as the duration of the applied magnetic field. The superparamagnetic maghemite nanocubes assemble into large and highly oriented thin arrays by applying the magnetic field perpendicular to the substrate surface only during the initial phase of drying-mediated self-assembly. Micrometer-sized and thick three-dimensional mesocrystals are obtained when the drying dispersion is subjected to an external magnetic field of moderate strength for the entire duration of the assembly process. The discovery of how translational and orientation order of nanocrystal superlattices can be induced by a temporal modulation of an anisotropic interparticle force offers new insight on the importance of the initial nucleation stage in the self-assembly process and suggests new routes for controlled self-assembly of dipolar nanocrystals.},

The collapse of the responsive chain leads to a protected state{,} where the nanoparticle is hidden in the polymer brush{,} while swelling of the responsive chain brings the nanoparticle outside of the brush into an exposed and active state. We investigate this system by numerical self-consistent field theory and predict a first-order like transition between the active state and the protective state at a critical decrease in solvent quality for the responsive chain. We show that by careful design of the brush parameters such as grafting density and chain length{,} for a given particle size{,} it is possible to fine-tune the desired switching mechanism.},

	Abstract = {The behavior of a linear polymer chain is studied in a solvent with high affinity for the polymer. The coil dimensions and specific heat are calculated as a function of chain length, solvent concentration, and polymer-solvent attraction strength εps. All other interactions are limited to excluded volume repulsion, which implies that the Flory-Huggins χ parameter is negative. Using both on-lattice and off-lattice models of a polymer chain in explicit solvent, we study a transition from weak to strong association regimes. In all cases studied, the system's heat capacity is a nonmonotonic function of ερs with a maximum at attraction strengths of the order of several kBT. This peak originates from restriction of local conformational degrees of freedom due to the associated solvent rather than from a partial chain collapse which onsets as attractive solvent content is decreased.},

The results have been compared with those for a monodisperse system. The internal structures of aggregates have been analyzed in terms of the radial distribution function in order to clarify the quantitative differences in the internal structures of clusters. In addition, the cluster size distribution and angular distribution function have been investigated. The results obtained in the present study are summarized as follows. In a monodisperse system, open necklacelike clusters are formed and they extend with increasing strength of the magnetic particle--particle interaction. In a polydisperse system with a small standard deviation in the particle size distribution, σ=0.2, larger necklacelike clusters are formed and some looplike clusters can also be observed. In a polydisperse system with a larger standard deviation, σ=0.35, clumplike clusters are formed for a weak magnetic particle--particle interaction. For a stronger magnetic interaction, larger size clusters that exhibit a complicated network structure are formed. These complicated cluster formations found in a polydisperse system are mainly due to the effect of the presence of larger particles.},

Magnetotactic bacteria synthesize bacterial magnetic particles (BacMPs) with well-controlled size and morphology. BacMPs are individually covered with thin organic membrane, which confers high and even dispersion in aqueous solutions compared with artificial magnetites, making them ideal biotechnological materials. Recent molecular studies including genome sequence, mutagenesis, gene expression and proteome analyses indicated a number of genes and proteins which play important roles for BacMP biomineralization. Some of the genes and proteins identified from these studies have allowed us to express functional proteins efficiently onto BacMPs, through genetic engineering, permitting the preservation of the protein activity, leading to a simple preparation of functional protein--magnetic particle complexes. They were applicable to high-sensitivity immunoassay, drug screening and cell separation. Furthermore, fully automated single nucleotide polymorphism discrimination and DNA recovery systems have been developed to use these functionalized BacMPs. The nano-sized fine magnetic particles offer vast potential in new nano-techniques.},

We present the most recent version 3.1 of our software, highlighting some recent algorithmic extensions to version 1.0 presented in a previous paper (Limbach et al. Comput Phys Commun 174:704--727, 2006). A major strength of our package is the multitude of implemented methods for calculating Coulomb and dipolar interactions in periodic and partially periodic geometries. Here we present some more recent additions which include methods for systems with dielectric contrasts that frequently occur in coarse-grained models of charged systems with implicit water models, and an alternative, completely local electrostatic solver that is based on the electrodynamic equations. We also describe our approach to rigid body dynamics that uses MD particles with fixed relative positions. ESPResSo now gained the ability to add bonds during the integration, which allows to study e.g. agglomeration. For hydrodynamic interactions, a thermalized lattice Boltzmann solver has been built into ESPResSo, which can be coupled to the MD particles. This computationally expensive algorithm can be greatly accelerated by using Graphics Processing Units. For the analysis of time series spanning many orders of magnitude in time scales, we implemented a hierarchical generic correlation algorithm for user-configurable observables.},

	Abstract = {Structure analysis of a magnetic fluid (nanoparticles of maghemite dispersed in water with charge stabilization and without surfactant) by means of small-angle neutron scattering is presented. A combination of the contrast variation technique and scattering of polarized neutrons was applied. In the first case, the scattering curves obtained for the unmagnetized fluid with variation of the heavy water content in the carrier are treated in terms of the basic functions approach. The almost homogeneous character of the nanoparticles with respect to the nuclear scattering length density makes it possible to separate information about their characteristic nuclear and magnetic radii. Polarized neutrons are then used to separate and analyze independently the nuclear and magnetic scattering contributions for the fully magnetized fluid. Both methods reveal a significant excess of the apparent nuclear size over the magnetic one, which is explained by a difference in the nonmagnetic and magnetic interactions in the system. The results indicate that from the viewpoint of magnetic interaction the studied fluid behaves under a magnetic field as a purely superparamagnetic system of independent particles. The magnetic scattering length density of the maghemite nanoparticles is found to be {$\sim$}25% less than the bulk value, which is in agreement with the data of the magnetization analysis.},

Polymer brushes, that is, assemblies of macromolecules tethered at one end to a substrate, provide an exemplary system of materials capable of achieving such a goal. While the focus in the past decades has been mostly on their synthetic aspects and the in-depth study of their interesting properties, from several years now the core area of research has already started to shift towards specific practical applications. Ample functional versatility and relative ease of preparation are special strengths of polymer brushes, lending them a strong interdisciplinary character. To this end, this work is entirely dedicated to bringing together the latest research on applications of polymer brushes in multiple research fields. The aim of this review are twofold: first, to give a critical discussion of the current status of development of application-oriented research on polymer brushes, and second, to inform the reader as to what can be done with polymer brushes in multiple research fields. It is therefore hoped that the juxtaposition of perspectives from different disciplines in one place will stimulate and contribute to the ongoing process of cross-fertilization that is driving this fascinating and emerging area of polymer science.},

@article{2010-buensow,
	Abstract = {Soft nanotechnology involves both understanding the behavior of soft matter and using these components to build useful nanoscale structures and devices. However, molecular scale properties such as Brownian motion, diffusion, surface forces, and conformational flexibility dominate the chemistry and physics in soft nanotechnology, and therefore the design rules for generating functional structures from soft, self-assembled materials are still developing. Biological motors illustrate how wet nanoscale machines differ from their macroscopic counterparts. These molecular machines convert chemical energy into mechanical motion through an isothermal process: chemical reactions generate chemical potential and diffusion of ions, leading to conformational changes in proteins and the production of mechanical force. Because the actuation steps form a thermodynamic cycle that is reversible, the application of mechanical forces can also generate a chemical potential. This reverse process of mechanotransduction is the underlying sensing and signaling mechanism for a wide range of physiological phenomena such as hearing, touch, and growth of bone. Many of the biological systems that respond to mechanical stimuli do this via complex stress-activated ion channels or remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. These biological actuation and mechanosensing processes are rather different from nano- and microelectromechanical systems (NEMS and MEMS) produced via semiconductor fabrication technologies. In our group, we are working to emulate biological mechanotransduction by systematically developing building blocks based on polymer brushes. In this soft nanotechnology approach to mechanotransduction, the chemical building blocks are polymer chains whose conformational changes and actuation can be investigated at a very basic level in polymer brushes, particularly polyelectrolyte brushes. Because these polymer brushes are easily accessible synthetically with control over parameters such as composition, chain length, and chain density, brushes provide a robust platform to study the coupling of mechanical forces with conformational changes of the chains. This Account provides an overview of our recent research in the design of mechanosensitive polymer brushes starting with the demonstration of nanoactuators and leading to our first attempts toward the creation of artificial mechanotransduction elements. As the brushes collapse in response to external triggers such as pH and ion concentration, polyelectrolyte brushes provide stimuli-responsive films. These collapse transitions lead to the generation of mechanical forces, and by reversing the chain of events, we designed a mechanically responsive film with a chemical output. Having reported an initial proof-of-principle experiment, we think that the stage is set for the preparation of more elaborate mechanosensitive surfaces.},

Previously, fleximags have been used as a basis for artificial micro-swimmers capable of transporting small cargos Dreyfus et al. (Nature, vol. 437, 2005, p. 862). Here, we demonstrate how these filaments can be anchored to a wall to make carpets of artificial micro-magnetic cilia with tunable densities. We analyse the dynamics of an artificial cilium under both planar and three-dimensional beating patterns. We show that the dynamics are controlled by a single characteristic length scale varying with the inverse square root of the driving frequency, providing a mechanism to break the fore and aft symmetry and to generate net fluxes and forces. However, we show that an effective geometrical reciprocity in the filament dynamics creates intrinsic limitations upon the ability of the artificial flagellum to pump fluid when driven in two dimensions.},

	Abstract = {Recently, it has been demonstrated [ Magee et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 207802 (2006)] that isolated square-well homopolymers can spontaneously break chiral symmetry and ``freeze'' into helical structures at sufficiently low temperatures. This behavior is interesting because the square-well homopolymer is itself achiral. In this work, we use event-driven molecular dynamics combined with an optimized parallel tempering scheme to study this polymer model over a wide range of parameters. We examine the conditions where the helix structure is stable and determine how the interaction parameters of the polymer govern the details of the helix structure. The width of the square well (proportional to λ) is found to control the radius of the helix, which decreases with increasing well width until the polymer forms a coiled sphere for sufficiently large wells. The helices are found to be stable for only a ``window'' of molecular weights. If the polymer is too short, the helix will not form. If the polymer is too long, the helix is no longer the minimum energy structure, and other folded structures will form. The size of this window is governed by the chain stiffness, which in this model is a function of the ratio of the monomer size to the bond length. Outside this window, the polymer still freezes into a locked structure at low temperature; however, unless the chain is sufficiently stiff, this structure will not be unique and is similar to a glassy state.},

The length of chain segments in very strong magnetic fields of up to 2 Tesla was measured in situ using small angle neutron scattering. Arrangement of the magnetic particles was studied with the scattering vector [Q with combining right harpoon above (vector)] aligned parallel to the magnetic field lines{,} and at angles of 30[degree] and 60[degree] with respect to [B with combining right harpoon above (vector)]. Although chains several hundred particles in length were predicted{,} we observe a maximum correlation length of [similar]65 nm equivalent to 3-4 particles up to highest fields. We speculate that the interaction between chains{,} i.e.{,} the interplay between the entropy and energy of the system combined with the particular properties of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction ultimately decide the length of the particle chains.},

	Abstract = {The transition of a solvated flexible macromolecular chain from random coil behavior in the &thetas;-state to a globular compact form in the collapsed state has been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental studies. Most of the coil-globule transition studies of macromolecules have concentrated on the prototypical polystyrene-cyclohexane system. However, chain contractions reported in this system have been around 75% of those in the unperturbed &thetas;-state. This relatively small decrease in size does not satisfy the criterion for a densely packed, collapsed globule. Experimentally, the collapse from a coil to a true compact globular state has now been established for two flexible macromolecules: poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) in water and poly(methyl methacrylate) in various solvents. In this contribution, we review recent theoretical studies covering phenomenological and Langevin models as well as computer simulations. In addition, we outline recent experimental studies of the coil-globule transition of various flexible polymers, copolymers, and polyelectrolytes.alphah2M},

	Abstract = {The persistence length of isotactic poly(hydroxy butyrate) was measured using small-angle neutron scattering. The value obtained from these measurements reflects a high degree of local chain persistence. If this local persistence is accounted for, scattering from these chains can be globally fit with Gaussian scaling. A global scattering function, the unified equation, is used, which decomposes the chain structure into two levels, one corresponding to the Gaussian regime and one to the persistence regime. The persistence length obtained using this global scattering function is compared to that obtained using the graphical approach of Kratky and Pored with good agreement. Additionally, the global fitting approach of Sharp and Bloomfield is also considered. The Kratky and the Sharp and Bloomfield approaches appear to yield different values for the persistence length. Additionally, the Sharp and Bloomfield function does not allow inspection of the component parts of the fit. One advantage of both global functions is that the level of statistical confidence in the persistence length can be determined in a least-squares fit. Another advantage is the removal of ambiguity concerning an apparent regime of non-Gaussian scaling between the persistence scaling regime and the Gaussian regime.},

The pumping principle is based on the rotation of ferromagnetic Janus microspheres around permalloy disks{,} driven by an external rotating magnetic field. By placing the disks close to the edge of the microchannel{,} a pumping rate of at least 0.3 nL min-1 was measured using tracking microspheres. Geometric programming of the pumping direction is possible by positioning the magnetic disk close to the side wall. A second degree of freedom in the pumping direction is offered by the rotational direction of the external magnetic field. This method is especially suited for flow-controlled recirculation of chemical and biological species in microchannels - for example{,} medium recirculation in culture chambers - opening the way towards novel{,} portable{,} on-chip applications without the need for external fluidic or electrical connections.},

	Abstract = {The self-assembly of dispersed polymer-coated ferromagnetic nanoparticles into micron-sized one-dimensional mesostructures at a liquid--liquid interface was reported. When polystyrene-coated Co nanoparticles (19 nm) are driven to an oil/water interface under zero-field conditions, long (≈ 5 μm) chain-like assemblies spontaneously form because of dipolar associations between the ferromagnetic nanoparticles. Direct imaging of the magnetic assembly process was achieved using a recently developed platform consisting of a biphasic oil/water system in which the oil phase was flash-cured within 1 s upon ultraviolet light exposure. The nanoparticle assemblies embedded in the crosslinked phase were then imaged using atomic force microscopy. The effects of time, temperature, and colloid concentration on the self-assembly process of dipolar nanoparticles were then investigated. Variation of either assembly time t or temperature T was found to be an interchangeable effect in the 1D organization process. Because of the dependence of chain length on the assembly conditions, we observed striking similarities between 1D nanoparticle self-assembly and polymerization of small molecule monomers. This is the first in-depth study of the parameters affecting the self-assembly of dispersed, dipolar nanoparticles into extended mesostructures in the absence of a magnetic field. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.* J Polym Sci Part B: Polym Phys 46: 2267--2277, 2008},

Polymer-coated ferromagnetic colloids (19 nm, 24 nm) were assembled at a crosslinkable oil−water interface under both magnetic field induced and zero-field conditions and permanently fixed into 1-D mesoscopic polymer chains (1−9 μm) in a process referred to as Fossilized Liquid Assembly (FLA). In the FLA process, nanoparticle chains were fixed at the oil interface through photopolymerization, enabling direct visualization of organized mesostructures using atomic force microscopy. Using the FLA methodology, we systematically investigated different conditions and demonstrated that dispersed ferromagnetic colloids possess sufficient dipolar interactions to organize into mesoscopic assemblies. Application of an external magnetic field during assembly enabled the formation of micron-sized chains which were aligned in the direction of the applied field. This universal methodology is an attractive alternative technique to cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) for the visualization of nanoparticle assembly in dispersed organic media.},

Based upon their shape{,} size{,} and articulation{,} these assemblies are potentially among the smallest structures capable of overcoming Brownian motion to perform useful locomotion. In addition to the head and tail structure{,} a variety of irregular structures formed that were incapable of swimming. A design of experiments (DOE) study was therefore implemented to optimize the production of artificial swimmers within a large parameter space that included concentration{,} the amount of sonication{,} and magnetic field strength. The artificial swimmers were most prevalent for intermediate concentrations of Co and magnetite particles. Statistical analysis suggested that the permanent dipole of the Co nanoparticles stimulated the assembly of the bidisperse mixture into complex{,} heterogeneous structures.

A custom microscope stage actuates the filaments through orthogonal permanent and alternating magnetic fields. We implemented design of experiments (DOE) to efficiently screen the effects of cobalt nanoparticle concentration, crosslinker concentration, and surface chemistry. The results indicated that the formation of dense, cilia-mimetic arrays could be explained by physical, non-covalent interactions (i.e. dipolar association forces) rather than chemistry. The experiments also determined an optimal Co nanoparticle concentration of approximately 500 µg ml-1 for forming dense arrays near the ends of the permanent magnets, and a critical concentration of approximately 0.3 µg ml-1, below which particle assembly into chains was not observed.},

These filaments can be magnetically regenerated on mechanical damage, owing to the fluidity of the capillary bridges between nanoparticles and their reversible binding on contact.

The conformational properties of such chain and its phase behavior are treated within a grand canonical ensemble (GCE) approach. We derive theoretical expressions for the mean size of loops, trains, and tails of an adsorbed chain under pulling as well as values for the universal exponents which describe their probability distribution functions. A central result of the theoretical analysis is the derivation of an expression for the crossover exponent ϕ, characterizing polymer adsorption at criticality, ϕ = α  1, which relates the precise value of ϕ to the exponent α, describing polymer loop statistics. We demonstrate that 1  γ11 < α < 1 + ν, depending on the possibility of a single loop to interact with neighboring loops in the adsorbed polymer. The universal surface loop exponent γ11 ≈ −0.39 and the Flory exponent ν ≈ 0.59. We present the adsorption−desorption phase diagram of a polymer chain under pulling and demonstrate that the relevant phase transformation becomes first order whereas in the absence of external force it is known to be a continuous one. The nature of this transformation turns to be dichotomic; i.e., coexistence of different phase states is not possible. These novel theoretical predictions are verified by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations.},

In this Perspective article{,} we focus on patchy systems characterized by spherical neutral particles with patchy surfaces. We summarize most of the patchy particle models that have been developed so far and describe how their basic features are connected to the physical systems they are meant to investigate. Patchy models consider particles as hard or soft spheres carrying a finite and small number of attractive sites arranged in precise geometries on the particle{'}s surface. The anisotropy of the interaction and the limited valence in bonding are the salient features determining the collective behavior of such systems. By tuning the number{,} the interaction parameters and the local arrangements of the patches{,} it is possible to investigate a wide range of physical phenomena{,} from different self-assembly processes of proteins{,} polymers and patchy colloids to the dynamical arrest of gel-like structures.

	Abstract = {Typically{,} patchy systems are characterized by the formation of a small number of directional{,} possibly selective{,} bonds due to the presence of attractive regions on the surface of otherwise repulsive particles. Here{,} we consider a new type of particles with patterned surfaces and we refer to them as inverse patchy colloids because{,} in this case{,} the patches on the repulsive particles repel each other instead of attracting. Further{,} these patches attract the parts of the colloid that are free of patches. Specifically{,} we consider heterogeneously charged colloids consisting of negatively charged spherical particles carrying a small number of positively charged patches. Making use of the Debye-Huckel theory{,} we derive the effective interaction potential between a pair of inverse patchy colloids with two patches on opposite poles.

	Abstract = {Theoretical descriptions of static properties of polymer brushes are reviewed, with an emphasis on monodisperse macromolecules grafted to planar, cylindrical, or spherical substrates. Blob concepts and resulting scaling relations are outlined, and various versions of the self-consistent field theory are summarized: the classical approximation and the strong stretching limit, as well as the lattice formulation. The physical justification of various inherent assumptions is discussed, and computer simulation results addressing the test of the validity of these approximations are reviewed. Also, alternative theories, such as the single chain mean field theory and the density functional theory, are briefly mentioned, and the main facts about the models used in the computer simulations are summarized. Both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations are described, the latter including lattice models and bead-spring models in the continuum. Also extensions such as brush--brush interactions or nanoparticles inside of brushes as well as the solubility of free chains in brushes are briefly mentioned. Pertinent experimental results, though still somewhat scarce, are mentioned throughout and their consequences on the status of the theoretical understanding of polymer brushes is emphasized.},

@article{2008-binder,
	Abstract = {The statistical mechanics of flexible and semiflexible macromolecules is distinct from that of small molecule systems, since the thermodynamic limit can also be approached when the number of (effective) monomers of a single chain (realizable by a polymer solution in the dilute limit) is approaching infinity. One can introduce effective attractive interactions into a simulation model for a single chain such that a swollen coil contracts when the temperature is reduced, until excluded volume interactions are effectively canceled by attractive forces, and the chain conformation becomes almost Gaussian at the theta point. This state corresponds to a tricritical point, as the renormalization group theory shows. Below the theta temperature a fluid globule is predicted (at nonzero concentration then phase separation between dilute and semidilute solutions occurs), while at still lower temperature a transition to a solid phase (crystal or glass) occurs. Monte Carlo simulations have shown, however, that the fluid globule phase may become suppressed, when the range of the effective attractive forces becomes too short, with the result that a direct (ultimately first-order) transition from the swollen coil to the solid occurs. This behavior is analogous to the behavior of colloidal particles with a very short range of attractive forces, where liquid--vapor-type phase separation may be suppressed. Analogous first-order transitions from swollen coils to dense rodlike or toroidal structures occur for semiflexible polymers. Finally, the modifications of the behavior discussed when the polymers are adsorbed at surfaces are also mentioned, and possible relations to wetting behavior of polymer solutions are addressed.},

	Abstract = {Magnetorheological particles, permanently linked into chains, provide a magnetically actuated means to manipulate microscopic fluid flow. Paramagnetic colloidal particles form reversible chains by acquiring dipole moments in the presence of an external magnetic field. By chemically connecting paramagnetic colloidal particles, flexible magnetoresponsive chains can be created. We link the paramagnetic microspheres using streptavidin-biotin binding. Streptavidin coated microspheres are placed in a flow cell and a magnetic field is applied, causing the particles to form chains. Then a solution of polymeric linkers of bis-biotin-poly(ethylene glycol) molecules is added in the presence of the field. These linked chains remain responsive to a magnetic field; however, in the absence of an external magnetic field these chains bend and flex due to thermal motion. The chain flexibility is determined by the length of the spacer molecule between particles and is quantified by the flexural rigidity or bending stiffness. To understand the mechanical properties of the chains, we use a variety of optical trapping experiments to measure the flexural rigidity. Increasing the length of the poly(ethylene glycol) chain in the linker increases the flexibility of the chains.},

	Abstract = {Historically most materials in magnetic applications are based on inorganic materials. Recently, however, organic and molecular materials have begun to show increasing promise. Purely organic ferromagnets, based upon nitronyl nitroxide radicals, show long range magnetic order at very low temperatures in the region of 1 K, while sulfur based radicals show weak ferromagnetism at temperatures up to 36 K. It is also possible to prepare molecule based magnets in which transition metal ions are used to provide the magnetic moment, but organic groups mediate the interactions. This strategy has produced magnetic materials with a large variety of structures, including chains, layered systems and three-dimensional networks, some of which show ordering at room temperature and some of which have very high coercivity. Even if long range magnetic order is not achieved, the spin crossover effect may be observed, which has important applications. Further magnetic materials may be obtained by constructing charge transfer salts, which can produce metallic molecular magnets. Another development is single-molecule magnets, formed by preparing small magnetic clusters. These materials can show macroscopic quantum tunnelling of the magnetization and may have uses as memory devices or in quantum computation applications.},

Specifically for the clamped-free case, eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes are determined. These theoretical results are compared to experiments. A good agreement is found, the discrepancies being attributed to the accumulation of defaults in the contact surface between the magnets.

We have previously demonstrated the ability to assemble dense brushes of magnetically actuated artificial cilia through the dipolar assembly of 24 nm ferromagnetic cobalt nanoparticles. With little more than a strategically placed permanent magnet{,} the nanoparticles assemble at room temperature in less than 60 s. Despite areal densities exceeding 1 cilium/[small mu ]m2{,} diameters below 25 nm{,} aspect ratios exceeding 400{,} and flexural rigidities below 3 [times] 10-28 N m2{,} these seemingly delicate structures resist collapse upon each other or the underlying substrate. The current study investigates the ability to rationally control their average length and areal density by changing the nanoparticle concentration and the dimensions of the rectangular capillary tube containing the dispersion. We find that the length and areal density obey a simple conservation of mass relationship with concentration and capillary height such that the product of the former is directly proportional to the product of the latter. Detailed statistical analysis supports a mechanism in which the role of the external field is to align pre-existing chains with the external field{,} assist stacking of chains along the axis of the field{,} and then draw them towards the ends of the permanent magnets{,} where the magnetic field gradient is steepest.},

	Abstract = {We report the formation of colloidal macromolecules consisting of chains of micron-sized paramagnetic particles assembled using a magnetic field and linked with DNA. The interparticle spacing and chain flexibility were controlled by varying the magnetic field strength and the linker spring constant. Variations in the DNA lengths allowed for the generation of chains with an improved range of flexibility as compared to previous studies. These chains adopted the rigid-rod, semiflexible, and flexible conformations that are characteristic of linear polymer systems. These assembly techniques were investigated to determine the effects of the nanoscale DNA linker properties on the properties of the microscale colloidal chains. With stiff DNA linkers (564 base pairs) the chains were only stable at moderate to high field strengths and produced rigid chains. For flexible DNA linkers (8000 base pairs), high magnetic field strengths caused the linkers to be excluded from the gap between the particles, leading to a transition from very flexible chains at low field strengths to semiflexible chains at high field strengths. In the intermediate range of linker sizes, the chains exhibited predictable behavior, demonstrating increased flexibility with longer DNA linker length or smaller linking field strengths. This study provides insight into the process of directed assembly using magnetic fields and DNA by precisely tuning the components to generate colloidal analogues of linear macromolecular chains.},

At a CTAB concentration [curly or open phi]c = 0.75 mM{,} comparable to the critical micelle concentration{,} a dilute NP monolayer is found with [capital Theta] [similar] 128[degree]. At lower surfactant concentration ([curly or open phi]c = 0.05 mM) we find a dense ML of close-packed NPs with an unexpectedly high [capital Theta] [similar] 146[degree]. The structure and adsorption scenarios of the NPs at the interface are discussed{,} highlighting the relevance of the present method for quantitative studies of a broad range of systems and applications.},

The self-aggregating patchy behavior can be fully controlled by the number of arms per star and by the fraction of attractive monomeric units at the free ends of the arms. Such self-assembled soft-patchy particles while forming, upon augmenting density, gel-like percolating networks, preserve properties as particle size, number, and arrangement of patches per particle. In particular, we demonstrate that the flexibility inherent in the soft-patchy particles brings forward a novel mechanism that leads to the mechanical stability of diamond and simple cubic crystals over a wide range of densities, and for molecular sizes ranging from about 10 nm up to the micrometer scale.},

	Abstract = {In the present work we use Langevin dynamics computer simulations to understand how the presence of a constant external magnetic field modifies the conformational phase diagram of magnetic filaments in the limit of infinite dilution. We have considered the filament immersed in either a good (non-sticky filaments) or a poor (Stockmayer polymers) solvent. It has been found that in the presence of an applied field, filaments turn out to be much more susceptible to parameters such as temperature and solvent conditions. Filaments owe this increased susceptibility to the fact that the external magnetic field tends to level the free energy landscape as compared to the zero-field case. The field induces an equalization in the free energy of competing conformational states that were separated by large energy differences in the zero-field limit. In this new scenario multistability arises, and manifests itself in the existence of broad regions in the phase diagram where two or more equilibrium configurations coexist. The existence of multistability greatly enhances the possibility of tuning the properties of the filament.},

We have seen that this process is twofold: (i) the chain adsorbs rather isotropically onto the surface at a characteristic temperature T-c and (ii) a further reduction in the temperature is needed for the chain to reorganize and adjust to the specific pattern. Such polymer reorganization has been studied through the evaluation of the chain degree of stretching and asphericity. We have found an optimal stripe width that maximizes the stretching.

Our results are compared with the theoretical predictions for ideal chains by Mondescu and Muthukumar (MM) (Phys. Rev. E 1998, 57, 4411) and Spakowitz and Wang (SW) (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2003, 91, 166102), respectively. The SW prediction is found to be in better agreement with our simulation results than the MM prediction in all the cases studied. Conformation of chains of length L and persistence length lp restricted to move on a sphere of radius R can be reasonably described by the SW formalism in the regime L/(2) < R < 2lp. For R/lp > 2, the mean square end-to-end distance, as a function of the chain length, evolves from a twodimensional(2D) self-avoiding random walk behavior to a saturation value. A rigid rod behavior is recovered in the limit of short and stiff chains. Unlike ideal chains, excluded volume chains confined to a spherical surface of large enough radius display a transition from a disordered to an helicoidal state as chain stiffness is increased. We have characterized this transition through the bond orientational correlation function and the Monte Carlo results reflect a balance between the bending energy and the excluded volume interactions.},

We have compared the behavior of several chain structures, such as homopolymers, diblocks, AB block copolymers, and random heteropolymers. In all the cases studied, we have found the adsorption process to be favored with an increase of the chain rigidity. Particularly, the adsorption of diblock structures becomes a two-step process characterized by two different adsorbing temperatures that depend on the chain stiffness, the chain length N, and the adsorbing energies A and B. This twofold adsorbing process changes to a single one for copolymers of reduced block size. Each block of the stiff copolymer chain is found to satisfy the classical scaling laws for flexible chains, however, we found the scaling exponent to depend on the chain stiffness. The measurement of the radius of gyration exhibits a typical behavior of a polymer chain composed of N/ lp blobs whose persistence length follows lp /kBT0.5 for large stiff chains.},

Three representative trajectories, namely, circular motion, back-and-forth oscillation, and a figure-of-eight pattern, of artificial cilia were designed and generated to mimic the motion of actual cilia. Homogeneous mixing of two highly viscous (>25 centipoise) dyed solutions by using the figure-of-eight trajectory achieved a mixing efficiency of approximately 86%.

	Abstract = {Proteins fold from a highly disordered state into a highly ordered one. Traditionally, the folding problem has been stated as one of predicting {\^a}€{\oe}the{\^a}€ tertiary structure from sequential information. However, new evidence suggests that the ensemble of unfolded forms may not be as disordered as once believed, and that the native form of many proteins may not be described by a single conformation, but rather an ensemble of its own. Quantifying the relative disorder in the folded and unfolded ensembles as an entropy difference may therefore shed light on the folding process. One issue that clouds discussions of {\^a}€{\oe}entropy{\^a}€ is that many different kinds of entropy can be defined: entropy associated with overall translational and rotational Brownian motion, configurational entropy, vibrational entropy, conformational entropy computed in internal or Cartesian coordinates (which can even be different from each other), conformational entropy computed on a lattice, each of the above with different solvation and solvent models, thermodynamic entropy measured experimentally, etc. The focus of this work is the conformational entropy of coil/loop regions in proteins. New mathematical modeling tools for the approximation of changes in conformational entropy during transition from unfolded to folded ensembles are introduced. In particular, models for computing lower and upper bounds on entropy for polymer models of polypeptide coils both with and without end constraints are presented. The methods reviewed here include kinematics (the mathematics of rigid-body motions), classical statistical mechanics, and information theory.},

	Abstract = { The growing adoption of generalized-ensemble algorithms for biomolecular simulation has resulted in a resurgence in the use of the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) to make use of all data generated by these simulations. Unfortunately, the original presentation of WHAM by Kumar et al. is not directly applicable to data generated by these methods. WHAM was originally formulated to combine data from independent samplings of the canonical ensemble, whereas many generalized-ensemble algorithms sample from mixtures of canonical ensembles at different temperatures. Sorting configurations generated from a parallel tempering simulation by temperature obscures the temporal correlation in the data and results in an improper treatment of the statistical uncertainties used in constructing the estimate of the density of states. Here we present variants of WHAM, STWHAM and PTWHAM, derived with the same set of assumptions, that can be directly applied to several generalized ensemble algorithms, including simulated tempering, parallel tempering (better known as replica-exchange among temperatures), and replica-exchange simulated tempering. We present methods that explicitly capture the considerable temporal correlation in sequentially generated configurations using autocorrelation analysis. This allows estimation of the statistical uncertainty in WHAM estimates of expectations for the canonical ensemble. We test the method with a one-dimensional model system and then apply it to the estimation of potentials of mean force from parallel tempering simulations of the alanine dipeptide in both implicit and explicit solvent. },

	Abstract = {The adsorption and self-assembly of linear polymers on smooth surfaces are studied using coarse-grained, bead-spring molecular models and Langevin dynamics computer simulations. The aim is to gain insight on atomic-force microscopy images of polymer films on mica surfaces, adsorbed from dilute solution following a good-solvent to bad-solvent quenching procedure. Under certain experimental conditions, a bimodal cluster distribution is observed. It is demonstrated that this type of distribution can be reproduced in the simulations, and rationalized on the basis of the polymer structures prior to the quench, i.e., while in good-solvent conditions. Other types of cluster distribution are described and explained. Measurements of the fraction of monomers bound to the surface, the film height, and the radius of gyration of an adsorbed polymer chain are also presented, and the trends in these properties are rationalized. In addition to providing insight into experimental observations, the simulation results support a number of predicted scaling laws such as the decay of the monomer density as a function of distance from the surface, and scaling of the film height with the strength of the polymer-surface interactions.},

Self-assembly of particles within polymer brushes, and ways to control the loading and location of nanoparticles inside polymer brushes will be described, as well as the possibility to use the brush templates as nanoreactors to generate metal nanoparticles. The combination of stimuli-responsive polymer brushes and nanoparticles exhibiting surface plasmon resonance, such as gold or silver, enables the design of optical sensors based on reversible variations of the brush conformation. Sensing devices are capable of detecting a variety of extrinsic variations in their surrounding enviroments.

@article{2004-cifra,
	Abstract = {Persistence length of (bio)macromolecules plays an increasingly important role in macromolecular science, especially in emerging fields like macromolecular biophysics. It is shown that using established approximate relations for the estimation of persistence length for semi-flexible macromolecules leads to differences between different methods or even to a modified behavior, especially at high chain stiffness. The approximate estimate obtained from the average bond angle (B) performs better than the estimate from the decay of bond orientation correlation (C) in chain but close to the coil-to-rod transition starts to fail. This approximate estimate is close to the estimate from the definition of persistence (D) (with minimum approximations) not only in the theta state or the random coil but also in the good solvent. The value of persistence from the decay of bond orientation correlation along the macromolecule is underestimated when compared to the exact value. The persistence obtained from the worm-like chain model (W) is close to the exact result in the coil regime (also in the good solvent) but near at and above the transition produces the largest values of all approximations. In systems with interactions this model starts to underestimate the persistence on decreasing temperature. We advocate using the estimate (D) of persistence length generally since it avoids limitations mentioned above and at the same time does not pose additional requirements on the evaluation itself.},

We take advantage of soft lithography and colloidal self-assembly to devise microcarpets made of hundreds of slender magnetic rods. This novel experimental setup is used to investigate the dynamics of extended cilia arrays driven by a precessing magnetic field. Whereas the dynamics of an isolated cilium is a rigid body rotation, collective beating results in a symmetry breaking of the precession patterns. The trajectories of the cilia are anisotropic and experience a significant structural evolution as the actuation frequency increases. We present a minimal model to account for our experimental findings and demonstrate how the global geometry of the array imposes the shape of the trajectories via long-range hydrodynamic interactions.},

The clusters determined by the algorithm would appear to be perfectly acceptable for this type of interaction.

	Abstract = { We introduce the novel concept of an intrinsic free energy profile, allowing one to remove the artificial smearing caused by thermal capillary waves, which renders difficulties for the calculation of free energy profiles across fluid interfaces in computer simulations. We apply this concept to the problem of a chloride ion crossing the interface between water and 1,2-dichloroethane and show that the present approach is able to reveal several important features of the free energy profile which are not detected with the usual, nonintrinsic calculations. Thus, in contrast to the nonintrinsic profile, a free energy barrier is found at the aqueous side of the (intrinsic) interface, which is attributed to the formation of a water ``finger'' the ion pulls with itself upon approaching the organic phase. Further, by the presence of a nonsampled region, the intrinsic free energy profile clearly indicates the coextraction of the first hydration shell water molecules of the ion when entering the organic phase. },

Polymer chains attain {"}brush{"}-like configuration when they are grafted or get localized at an interface (solid-fluid or liquid-fluid) with sufficiently close proximity between two-adjacent grafted polymer chains - such a proximity triggers a particular nature of interaction between the adjacent polymer molecules forcing them to stretch orthogonally to the grafting interface{,} instead of random-coil arrangement. In this review{,} we discuss the theory{,} synthesis{,} and applications of PE brushes. The theoretical discussion starts with the standard scaling concepts for polymer and PE brushes; following that{,} we shed light on the state of the art in continuum modelling approaches for polymer and PE brushes directed towards analysis beyond the scaling calculations. A special emphasis is laid in pinpointing the cases for which the PE electrostatic effects can be de-coupled from the PE entropic and excluded volume effects; such de-coupling is necessary to appropriately probe the complicated electrostatic effects arising from pH-dependent charging of the PE brushes and the use of these effects for driving liquid and ion transport at the interfaces covered with PE brushes. We also discuss the atomistic simulation approaches for polymer and PE brushes. Next we provide a detailed review of the existing approaches for the synthesis of polymer and PE brushes on interfaces{,} nanoparticles{,} and nanochannels{,} including mixed brushes and patterned brushes.

@article{2006-dasmahapatra,
	Abstract = {We present dynamic Monte Carlo lattice simulations of the coil to globule collapse of single chains of a copolymer comprising monomer units, m and c, wherein there is a net attractive interaction between c-units. As the copolymer is cooled, the solvent quality becomes poorer, and the size of the chain decreases, driven by the net m−m and c−c attractions. The strong c−c attraction increases the overall solvophobicity of the chain relative to a homopolymer and, therefore, copolymers collapse more abruptly and at a higher effective temperature relative to homopolymers. We compare copolymers with homopolymers by rescaling collapse data to the same θ values to account for the effect of overall solvophobicity. This comparison shows that the behavior of copolymers and the corresponding homopolymers is identical as the chain size reduces from high temperatures to the θ value. Beyond θ, copolymers with c-content <50% collapse more abruptly than either homopolymer, after accounting for the difference in overall solvophobicity. Collapse of copolymers containing higher c-content is dominated entirely by the c−c attractions, and these chains behave qualitatively like homopolymers with a higher effective solvophobicity. Analysis of the chain structure during collapse provides a structural reason for the qualitative change in copolymer collapse at low c-content. When such copolymers are cooled below θ, the c-units rapidly aggregate to form an isotropic, compact core surrounded by an anisotropic solvated shell of m-units. The shell densifies as the copolymer is further cooled, but remains anisotropic for the finite chain sizes investigated.},

In comparison, random copolymers collapse through a relatively less-compact intermediate comprising a comonomer core surrounded by a fluffy monomer shell that densifies over a wide temperature range. This difference between the collapse pathways for random and uniform copolymers persists to higher chain lengths, where uniform copolymers tend to form multiple comonomer cores. In this paper, we describe the formation of such an intermediate state, and the subsequent collapse, by recognizing that these arise from the expected balance between comonomer aggregation enthalpy and loop formation entropy dictated by the chain microstructure.},

At the critical adsorption strength epsilonc one has Mc~Nphi, and we find (using the above results) as best candidate phi to equal 0.59. However, slight changes in the estimation of epsilonc lead to large deviations in the resulting phi; this might be a possible reason for the difference in the phi values reported in the literature. We also investigate the dynamical scaling behavior at epsilonc, by focusing on the end-to-end correlation function and on the correlation function of monomers adsorbed at the wall. We find that at epsilonc the dynamic scaling exponent a (which describes the relaxation time of the chain as a function of N) is the same as that of free chains. Furthermore, we find that for tethered chains the modes perpendicular to the surface relax quicker than those parallel to it, which may be seen as a splitting in the relaxation spectrum.},

The well-defined size and shape and the uniform surfactant coating layer of the cobalt nanoparticles enable quantitative calculations of particle--particle and particle--interface interactions. The experiments, in conjunction with cluster-moving Monte Carlo simulations mimicking the self-assembly in solution and dynamics during solvent evaporation, have revealed three key factors that influence the ring formation most, i.e., FMNP density, dipolar strength, and surfactant layers. Two very different mechanisms of the FMNP-ring formation are found by changing these factors. The results provide a guide to the fabrication of nanorings as well as diverse patterns assembled by FMNPs.},

The peculiarity of computer simulation is to study two different systems: dipolar and soft sphere ones. In the theoretical method, it is important to choose the approximation for the main structures, which are chains. We compare the theoretical results and the computer simulation data for the self-diffusion coefficient as a function of the particle volume fraction and magnetic dipole-dipole interaction parameter and find the qualitative and quantitative agreement to be good. },

	Abstract = {To design modern materials with a specific response{,} the consequences of directionally dependent interactions on the self-assembly of constituent nanoparticles need to be properly understood. Directionality arises in the study of anisometric nanoparticles{,} where geometry has a drastic effect on the properties observed. Given the fact that magnetic interactions are inherently anisotropic{,} if one constructs these particles from a magnetic medium{,} an interesting interplay between the two sources of directionality will occur. We have investigated this scenario by exploring systems of dipolar nanocube monolayers. Using an applied analytical approach{,} in combination with molecular dynamics simulations{,} we have determined the ground state structures of individual monolayer clusters. Taking inspiration from experiments{,} two different fixed dipole orientations for the permanent magnetisation of the nanocubes were considered: the first aligned along the [001] crystallographic axis of each cube{,} and the second along the [111] axis. We discovered that the structure of the ground state is distinctly different for the two systems of permanently magnetised nanocubes; [001] cubes form dipolar chains in the ground state{,} whereas those with [111] orientation adopt square lattice structures. The discovered configurations in the ground state represent two different structural motifs{,} as yet unobserved in the ground state of other magnetic nanoparticle systems.},

For example, bacterial flagella are helically shaped2 and driven at their bases by a reversible rotary engine3, which rotates the attached flagellum to give a motion similar to that of a corkscrew. In contrast, eukaryotic cells use flagella that resemble elastic rods4 and exhibit a beating motion: internally generated stresses give rise to a series of bends that propagate towards the tip5, 6, 7. In contrast to this variety of swimming strategies encountered in nature, a controlled swimming motion of artificial micrometre-sized structures has not yet been realized. Here we show that a linear chain of colloidal magnetic particles linked by DNA and attached to a red blood cell can act as a flexible artificial flagellum. The filament aligns with an external uniform magnetic field and is readily actuated by oscillating a transverse field. We find that the actuation induces a beating pattern that propels the structure, and that the external fields can be adjusted to control the velocity and the direction of motion.},

Small-angle neutron scattering experiments prove that there is no chaining of the particles and that, from the point of view of interparticle interactions, increasing ionic strength (through addition of NaCl) is equivalent to decreasing temperature. A phenomenological expression of the osmotic pressure π is determined and shown to be in agreement with direct π measurements. The scattering experiments associated to optical microscopy determinations of phase diagrams lead to a general pi-phi diagram. Gas-solid transitions may exist even if their observation is disturbed by metastability phenomena.

The dynamics of particles forming a chain is analyzed theoretically taking into account the magnetic dipole interaction as well as the Van der Waals molecular interaction. The vibrational spectrum has two branches (the magnetic branch associated with the rotation of the magnetic moment of a particle and the elastic branch associated with the displacement of particles). In the case of particles with constant mass density and magnetic moment, which is interesting for applications, these two modes are in fact independent; i.e., the effects of mode hybridization are weak. However, these effects can be manifested for hollow particles. From analysis of the vibrational spectrum, the criterion for the chain stability to a transition to a denser phase is established.},

Particular attention is paid to the region around the temperature Ta below which the polymer becomes adsorbed to the wall, i.e., where the typical polymer linear dimensions perpendicular to the wall become independent of chain length. Both ideal noninteracting chains and chains with excluded volume interactions are treated. Polymer linear dimensions parallel and perpendicular to the wall and their probability distributions are studied, as well as the behavior of the monomer fraction at the surface and a distance z in the interior. The relation of polymer statistics to the problem of correlation functions in the n-vector model of magnetism in the limit n-->0 is exploited to express both the exponents describing the various power laws and the crossover scaling functions near Ta in terms of results for the analogous problem of the critical behavior of magnets with a free surface. The predictions of this scaling theory are confirmed by Monte Carlo studies of self-avoiding walks on the tetrahedral lattice with a free surface, and estimates for the exponents involved are presented. A new sampling technique with a bias in favor of adsorbed polymer configurations is developed.},

Introducing monomers capable of strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding is a promising route to achieve this control. In the present work we report the use of Wang-Landau Monte Carlo simulations of coarse-grained copolymers to explore the design parameters of these systems on their pathway to collapse. The highly directional nature of hydrogen-bonded supramolecular interactions is modelled by a directional non-bonded potential while a harmonic bending potential is used to take into account the flexibility of the polymer chain{,} thus making it possible to look at the interplay of both factors. The introduction of directional interactions in the copolymer chain leads to a sharper coil-globule collapse when compared to homopolymers composed of isotropic interacting beads only. Simultaneously{,} some of the stiffness-dependent structural properties become exacerbated when directional beads are present. Finally{,} from the heat capacity profiles for the different chain stiffness values we are able to distinguish the prevalence of the collapse of the backbone for highly flexible chains{,} while as chain stiffness increases folding of the co-polymer due to the directional interactions becomes the dominant feature.},

	Abstract = {The combination of polymers with nano- or microsized solid materials displays novel and often enhancedproperties compared to the traditional materials. They can open up possibilities for new technologicalapplications. Materials whose physical properties can be varied by application of magnetic fields belongto a specific class of smart materials. The broad family of magnetic field-controllable soft materialsincludes ferrofluids, magneto-rheological fluids, magnetic gels, and magnetic elastomers. The magneticgels and elastomers (magnetoelasts) represent a new type of composite and consist of small magneticparticles, usually in the nanometer to micron range, dispersed in a highly elastic polymeric matrix.The magnetic particles can be incorporated into the elastic body either randomly or in ordered structure.If a uniform magnetic field is applied to the reactive mixture during the cross-linking process, particlechains form and become locked into the elastomer. The resulting composites exhibit anisotropic properties.

Combination of magnetic and elastic properties leads to a number of striking phenomena that areexhibited in response to impressed magnetic fields. The magnetic particles couple the shape and the elasticmodulus with the external magnetic field. Giant deformational effects, high elasticity, anisotropic elasticand swelling properties, and quick response to magnetic fields open new opportunities for using such materialsfor various applications. Since the magnetic fields are convenient stimuli from the point of signal control,the magnetoelasts are promising smart materials in engineering due to their real-time controllable elasticproperties.

More recently, increasing interest has been devoted to exploration of multiresponsive magnetic polymers,which exhibit sensitivity to several external stimuli. Micro- and nanospheres that combine both magnetic,temperature, and pH sensitivity were also elaborated and studied. These new results provide novel possibilitiesfor preparation of more complex magnetic field-responsive materials like membranes with on/off switchingcontrol.

In this article, we review recent advances in mechanical and swelling behavior of magnetic field-responsivesoft materials, including flexible polymer networks and gels.},

We report here the synthesis of a polyelectrolyte gel that incorporates magnetic particles of iron oxide into the polymer network; these particles couple the gel volume transition to the NMR relaxation times of the surrounding water. We find that the water proton relaxation rates (T 2 -1) in aqueous suspensions of particles of the magnetic gel increase significantly in an electric field. Such changes can also be induced by the hyperpolarization of red blood cells in the suspension, presumably as a result of the electric fields at the cell membrane surfaces. These gels may play a part in magnetic resonance imaging analogous to that of voltage-sensitive dyes in optical imaging6-9.},

	Abstract = {The present paper is a generalization of a preceding note on the statistical theory of condensation phenomena. It is based on the idea that the macroscopic transition of a substance from a phase A to a phase B is preceded by the formation of small nuclei of the B phase within A, these nuclei being treated as resulting from ``heterophase'' density fluctuations or as manifestations of a generalized statistical equilibrium in which they play the roles of dissolved particles, whereas the A phase can be considered as the solvent. The application of the general theory to premelting phenomena in crystals leads to a quantitative explanation of the abnormal increase of the specific heat of the thermal expansion coefficient (and of the electric conductivity, in the case of ionic substances) in the close neighborhood of the conventional melting point, with the result that the surface tension between a crystal and its melt must be of the order of 1 dyne/cm. This result is checked by a calculation of the temperature corresponding to the highest crystallization rate of an overcooled liquid. Transitions of higher order and Curie points are also briefly discussed from the same point of view.},

On the basis of a simple free energy description, we describe the ``on'' and ``off'' states of the switch brush, where the switch between states is driven by a change in solvency for the solvent-responsive monomers. These solvent-responsive monomers reside at the brush surface, exposed to solvent, in an on state but are sequestered within the dense brush, sheltered from solvent contact, in an off state. The model considers persistent-on states where the responsive monomers form globules, micelles, and pancake layers at the brush surface under poor solvent conditions. These persistent-on states decrease the sensitivity of the switch to solvent, but they also increase the signal when the switch is activated. We describe the on and off states, as well as the switch sensitivity and signaling, over design parameters that include the size of the homopolymer chains and solvent-responsive blocks, and the fraction of chains appended with these responsive monomers.},

These polymers are modeled as self-avoiding walks on a cubic lattice, and the ferromagnetic interaction between the spins carried by the monomers is short-ranged in space. At low temperature, these polymers undergo a magnetic induced first order collapse transition, that we study at the mean field level. Contrasting with an ordinary point, there is a strong jump in the polymer density, as well as in its magnetization. In the presence of a magnetic field, the collapse temperature increases, while the discontinuities decrease. Beyond a multicritical point, the transition becomes second order and -like. Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising case are in qualitative agreement with these results.},

The filament is made of superparamagnetic particles linked together by DNA double strands. An external magnetic field induces dipolar interactions between the beads of the filament which provides a convenient way of actuating the cilium in a well-controlled manner. The filament has recently been used to successfully construct the first artificial micro-swimmer (R. Dreyfus et al., Nature 437, 862 (2005)). In our numerical study we introduce a measure, which we call pumping performance, to quantify the fluid transport induced by the magnetically actuated cilium and identify an optimum stroke pattern of the filament. It consists of a slow transport stroke and a fast recovery stroke. Our detailed parameter study also reveals that for sufficiently large magnetic fields the artificial cilium is mainly governed by the Mason number that compares frictional to magnetic forces. Initial studies on multi-cilia systems show that the pumping performance is very sensitive to the imposed phase lag between neighboring cilia, i.e., to the details of the initiated metachronal wave.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed numerical study of a microscopic artificial swimmer realized recently by Dreyfus et al. in experiments [Dreyfus et al., Nature 437, 862 (2005)]. It consists of an elastic filament composed of superparamagnetic particles that are linked together by DNA strands. Attached to a load particle, the resulting swimmer is actuated by an oscillating external magnetic field so that it performs a nonreciprocal motion in order to move forward. We model the superparamagnetic filament by a bead-spring configuration that resists bending like a rigid rod and whose beads experience friction with the surrounding fluid and hydrodynamic interactions with each other. We show that, aside from finite-size effects, its dynamics is governed by the dimensionless sperm number, the magnitude of the magnetic field, and the angular amplitude of the field's oscillating direction. Then we study the mean velocity and the efficiency of the swimmer as a function of these parameters and the size of the load particle. In particular, we clarify that the real velocity of the swimmer is influenced by two main factors, namely the shape of the beating filament (determined by the sperm number and the magnetic-field strength) and the oscillation frequency. Furthermore, the load size influences the performance of the swimmer and has to be chosen as a compromise between the largest swimming velocity and the best efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that the direction of the swimming velocity changes in a symmetry-breaking transition when the angular amplitude of the field's oscillating direction is increased, in agreement with experiments.},

Here, we demonstrate the formation mechanism of 2D PbSe superstructures with square geometry by using in situ grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (small angle and wide angle), ex situ electron microscopy, and Monte Carlo simulations. We observed nanocrystal adsorption at the liquid/gas interface, followed by the formation of a hexagonal nanocrystal monolayer. The hexagonal geometry transforms gradually through a pseudo-hexagonal phase into a phase with square order, driven by attractive interactions between the {100} planes perpendicular to the liquid substrate, which maximize facet-to-facet overlap. The nanocrystals then attach atomically via a necking process, resulting in 2D square superlattices.},

By transforming cartographical data into numbers, which are mathematically far more tractable, similar insights may be forthcoming in geography. After a consideration of the nature of eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors, a wide variety of different applications is examined by reference to specific examples. These include analyses of terrain roughness on the New Jersey Coastal Plain, the Allegheny Plateau and the adjacent Ridge and Valley Province; connectivity matrices, as applied to the study of road networks in Uganda and Syria at different periods; the orientation of features as different as stream pebbles and transport networks in Tanzania and Sierra Leone; the diffusion of information; regional classification, by reference to church forms in Centre County, Pennsylvania; and principal components, in relation to the ranked preferences of university students in Ghana and Europe for different areas.

We have established useful parameter ranges for simulations, and have made a link between these parameters and χ-parameters in Flory-Huggins-type models. This is possible because the equation of state of the DPD fluid is essentially quadratic in density. This link opens the way to do large scale simulations, effectively describing millions of atoms, by firstly performing simulations of molecular fragments retaining all atomistic details to derive χ-parameters, then secondly using these results as input to a DPD simulation to study the formation of micelles, networks, mesophases and so forth. As an example application, we have calculated the interfacial tension σ between homopolymer melts as a function of \chi and N and have found a universal scaling collapse when \sigma/\rhokBT\chi0.4 is plotted against \chiN for N>1. We also discuss the use of DPD to simulate the dynamics of mesoscopic systems, and indicate a possible problem with the timescale separation between particle diffusion and momentum diffusion (viscosity).},

The dependence of the probability, P ( N ) , on the number of balls, N, follows a Poisson-like distribution. The origin of this Poisson distribution is disclosed by the statistics. Based on the classical ``spin dynamics-molecular dynamics'', the stability of the ring structure was also investigated. The peak of function P ( N ) vs. N at 9 and the non-existence of rings with N = 3 and N > 20 is shown. An internal scaling relation between P ( N ) and the critical field h c ( N ) for breaking the ring is found.},

	Abstract = {Strong magnets, such as neodymium-iron-boron magnets, are increasingly being manufactured as spheres. Because of their dipolar characters, these spheres can easily be arranged into long chains that exhibit mechanical properties reminiscent of elastic strings or rods. While simple formulations exist for the energy of a deformed elastic rod, it is not clear whether or not they are also appropriate for a chain of spherical magnets. In this paper, we use discrete-to-continuum asymptotic analysis to derive a continuum model for the energy of a deformed chain of magnets based on the magnetostatic interactions between individual spheres. We find that the mechanical properties of a chain of magnets differ significantly from those of an elastic rod: while both magnetic chains and elastic rods support bending by change of local curvature, nonlocal interaction terms also appear in the energy formulation for a magnetic chain. This continuum model for the energy of a chain of magnets is used to analyze small deformations of a circular ring of magnets and hence obtain theoretical predictions for the vibrational modes of a circular ring of magnets. Surprisingly, despite the contribution of nonlocal energy terms, we find that the vibrations of a circular ring of magnets are governed by the same equation that governs the vibrations of a circular elastic ring.},

	Abstract = {Tethered polymer chains refers to macromolecular chains that are attached into microstructures by their ends. Highly branched polymers, polymer micelles and end-grafted chains on surfaces are a few examples. This review brings out the common features of these seemingly widely disparate microstructures. Tethering can be reversible or irreversible and is frequently sufficiently dense that the chains are crowded. Densely tethered chains stretch to alleviate the interactions caused by crowding. They thus exhibit deformed configurations at equilibrium. These effects of tethering on the structure of the polymer chains are reflected in distinctive behavior and properties of microstructures containing tethered chains.
The topics we cover are: structure, in which the relationships of the free energy and characteristic dimensions of tethered chains to chain contour length, grafting density and geometry are developed; aggregation, by which we mean equilibrium microstructures formed by self-assembly such as micelles, adsorbed layers or ordered phases in block copolymers, where we can illustrate how the structural concepts come into play; phase behavior, which occurs, for example, in structures having more than one tethered component, such as mixed micelles; block copolymer melts, which are important systems which manifest the characteristics of tethered chains in both the aggregation and phase behavior, interactions, in which the behavior of two tethered layers in contact is explored, a subject of importance to applications involving colloidal stability; and kinetics and dynamics, where the chain deformation arising from tethering affects the kinetics of assembly and exchange processes and the entanglement behavior.},

The opposite phase is either cyclohexane or water, but as a reference, IL--vacuum interfaces are also studied. We combine a distance-based cluster search algorithm with the ITIM intrinsic analyzing method to separate liquid phases showing non-negligible mutual miscibility and to identify atoms residing at the instantaneous surface. In contrast to the well structured surface of IL--vacuum systems, at liquid/liquid interfaces of ILs density correlations, ionic associations, and orientational preferences are all weakened, this effect being much more pronounced when the other species is water. In such systems we observe a drastic reduction in the presence of the cation at the surface and an increase of appearance of polar moieties (of both the cations and anions) leading to decreased apolar character of the interface. Furthermore, cations are mostly found to turn with their butyl chains toward the bulk while having their methyl groups sticking toward water. Anion--cation associations are reduced and partially replaced by water--anion and rarely also water--cation associations.},

We begin with a general discussion of nanoparticles capable of 1-D self-organization to form 1-D assemblies, which we term colloidal polymers. The need for efficient, highly directional interactions prompted our investigation with polymer-coated ferromagnetic nanoparticles, which spontaneously form linear assemblies through coupling of north and south magnetic poles present in these single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles. These highly directional N--S interactions and the resulting formation of 1-D assemblies can be understood in the context of traditional polymer-forming reactions. The dipolar assembly of these ferromagnetic nanoparticles into chains and binary assemblies while dispersed in organic media has been investigated as a key foundation to form novel magnetic materials and heterostructured nanocomposites. These studies enabled the fabrication of magnetic nanoactuating systems resembling "artificial cilia and flagella". We then discuss our recent efforts to prepare cobalt oxide nanowires using various nanoparticle conversion reactions through a process termed colloidal polymerization. A series of novel functional ``colloidal monomers'' based on dipolar cobalt nanoparticles were also prepared, incorporating noble metal or semiconductor nanoinclusions to form heterostructured cobalt oxide nanocomposites.},

	Abstract = {Molecular dynamic simulations of salt-free polyelectrolyte brushes subject to external fields applied normal to the grafting substrate reveal the three-dimensional monomer and counterion distributions. It is found that below a critical electric field, local electroneutrality holds for densely grafted brushes and the brush height remains independent of field intensity. Above this critical field (which scales as 1/3 with grafting density) brush height increases smoothly, and the fraction of condensed counterions decreases. The brush bifurcates into two subpopulations of stretched and collapsed chains when the grafting density is not low. At intermediate grafting densities, the majority of chains are stretched and the minority are nonstretched. At high grafting densities bifurcation and brush height growth occur consecutively. The majority of the chains are nonstretched at high grafting densities. Although not observed prior to overstretching of the chain model, it is predicted that the two subpopulations will re-merge to a single highly stretched phase when field intensity reaches a third critical value. The ability to control subpopulations of chains suggests that utilizing electric fields normal to polyelectrolyte brushes holds potential as controllable gates in microfluidic devices.},

Inhomogeneous local ordering of the particles is observed for different in-plane directions. The anisotropy of the interaction as well as of the liquid structure is increased by increasing the tilt angle. Furthermore, the particles favour an alignment in the direction of the in-plane component of the magnetic field. For increasing tilt angle, the anisotropy of the structural correlations is qualitatively similar to that of the corresponding solid lattice which is stable at lower temperatures. However, the mean-square displacements behave qualitatively different in the solid and fluid phases as a function of the tilt angle.},

	Abstract = {In the present paper we compare the static magnetic properties of a bidisperse ferrofluid obtained via computer simulations with the predictions of the theoretical chain model. At weak fields, the computer simulations showed a strong dependence of the magnetization on the concentration of large particles. When the latter is small the magnetization behavior is close to the one given by the modified mean field approach, but at higher concentrations of large particles the initial susceptibility increases significantly. This increase cannot be described in terms of the modified mean field model for the homogeneous system. A new theoretical approach for the description of the static magnetic properties of a bidisperse ferrofluid was developed. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the results of a recent computer simulation study.},

An extensive comparison of the theoretical predictions to the results of the computer simulations is provided. Both magnetostatic properties and structural observables are investigated with the help of the newly developed theoretical approach and molecular dynamic simulations. It is shown that the results of the cluster analysis are very sensitive to the cluster definition. Here we use two different criteria for the particles to be bound: an energy criterion which is slightly different in the theory and simulations due to technical problems, and an entropy criterion which is the same for the molecular dynamics and theoretical model. This enables us to compare qualitatively and quantitatively theoretical and numerical microstructural observables, as well as the macro properties of the bidisperse ferrofluids. Finally, an answer to the question which chain criterion should actually be used is provided in this paper.},

These objects structure their environment and it is natural to assume that the influence these objects exert on their environment depends on the distance from the line object. But how should this be defined? We argue here that there is an intrinsic length scale along the undulating line that is a measure of its stiffness (i.e., orientational persistence), which yields a natural way of defining the variation of physical properties normal to the undulating line. We exemplify how this normal variation can be determined from a computer simulation for the case of a so-called bottle-brush polymer, where side chains are grafted onto a flexible backbone.},

	Abstract = {On the basis of extensive Monte Carlo simulations of lattice models for linear chains under good and Θ solvents conditions, and for bottle-brush polymers under good solvent conditions, different methods to estimate the persistence lengths of these polymers are applied and compared to each other. While for chain molecules at the Θ point standard textbook definitions of the persistence length yield consistent results, under good solvent conditions the persistence length (according to its standard definitions) diverges when the chain length of the macromolecules tends to infinity. Accurate simulation results for chain lengths up to Nb = 6400 allow us to verify the theoretically predicted power laws for the decay of the bond orientational correlation function. For the case of bottle-brush polymers, this dependence of ``the'' persistence length on the backbone chain length obscures the dependence on the side chain length, that is controversially discussed in the literature. Alternative definitions of a persistence length that do not suffer from this problem, based on the total linear dimension of the chain or on the scattering function via the so-called ``Holtzer plateau'' are studied as well. We show that the backbone contour length of the bottle-brush needs to be very large (about 100 persistence lengths in typical cases) to reach the asymptotic limit where the bottle-brush satisfies the self-avoiding walk statistics, and where a well-defined persistence length can be extracted. An outlook to pertinent experimental work is given.},

Responsive polymers can exist in the form of solutions, gels, self-assembled nanoparticles, (multilayer) films, and bulk solids. The field of responsive polymers has nowadays evolved well beyond the demonstration of novel and interesting properties. Currently, the exploitation of useful and advanced functions, e.g., drug or gene carriers with triggered release properties, catalysis, detection and imaging, environmentally adaptive coatings, and self-healing materials, has emerged to be a more relevant subject. In this Perspective, we focus on recent developments of responsive polymer-based chemo- and biosensors, highlighting this concept with selected literature reports. Such functional polymeric materials show prominent advantages such as tunable detection sensitivity, structural stability, aqueous dispersibility, biocompatibility, processability, and facile integration into detection devices, as compared to their small molecule analogues.},

	Abstract = {The structure of a ferrofluid under the influence of an external magnetic field is expected to become anisotropic due to the alignment of the dipoles into the direction of the external field, and subsequently to the formation of particle chains due to the attractive head to tail orientations of the ferrofluid particles. Knowledge about the structure of a colloidal ferrofluid can be inferred from scattering data via the measurement of structure factors. We have used molecular-dynamics simulations to investigate the structure of both monodispersed and polydispersed ferrofluids. The results for the isotropic structure factor for monodispersed samples are similar to previous data by Camp and Patey that were obtained using an alternative Monte Carlo simulation technique, but in a different parameter region. Here we look in addition at bidispersed samples and compute the anisotropic structure factor by projecting the q vector onto the XY and XZ planes separately, when the magnetic field was applied along the z axis. We observe that the XY-plane structure factor as well as the pair distribution functions are quite different from those obtained for the XZ plane. Further, the two-dimensional structure factor patterns are investigated for both monodispersed and bidispersed samples under different conditions. In addition, we look at the scaling exponents of structure factors. Our results should be of value to interpret scattering data on ferrofluids obtained under the influence of an external field.},

When the applied mechanical load is within a certain range{,} the effective stiffness of the structure can be tuned by several orders of magnitude with the applied magnetic field. The performance of the structure and its dependence on various synthesis parameters{,} such as the curing field and filler concentration{,} were investigated experimentally. It is found that the increase in the critical load for buckling is more than the contribution from the stiffening of the MR elastomer. To unravel the relationship between the stiffness increase and the applied field{,} a theoretical model with coupled mechanical deformation and magnetic field is established. The prediction of the model agrees well with experimental results. The theory may also be used to model the behaviour of other similar materials{,} such as MR gels. The MR brush developed in this research holds promise for potential applications in smart structures or devices that require mechanical stiffness to be tuneable in a relatively large range. As the amplification mechanism is independent of the base material{,} it could be used in conjunction with emerging MR materials for further enhanced performance.},

The phase-averaged flow produced by the artificial cilia reached up to 130 [small mu ]m s-1 with an actuation cycle frequency of 10 Hz.

This corresponds to an effective pressure gradient of 6 +/- 1 Pa m-1{,} which equals a pressure difference of 0.6 +/- 0.1 mPa over a distance of 100 [small mu ]m between two rows of cilia. These results were derived analytically from the measured velocity profile by treating the cilia as a thin boundary layer. While the cilia produce phase-averaged velocities of the order of O(102 [small mu ]m s-1){,} time-resolved measurements showed that the flow field reverses two times during one actuation cycle inducing instantaneous velocities of up to approximately 2 mm s-1.

Intending to probe the contribution of the different subsets of conformations, namely, globule, coil and stretch, we supplement PN(t) with a formal Boltzmann factor; this model undergoes a tricritical coil-globule transition which is solved exactly. We show a nontrivial finite-size scaling for PN(t) and analyze its convergence toward the thermodynamic limit. Due to the presence in PN(t) of a diverging factor tc with c<-1, this convergence happens to be tragically slow. As a result, the scaling behavior observed in numerical simulations is qualitatively different from its thermodynamic limit, and we relate the critical exponents of the geometric transition in the thermodynamic limit and the effective exponents observed at finite size.},

The development of such nanoparticle-based materials is facilitated by structural characterization techniques that are able to monitor in situ the self-assembly process during its evolution. Here{,} we present an in situ high-energy X-ray reflectivity study of the evolution of the vertical position (contact angle) and inter-particle spacing of core-shell iron oxide-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) nanoparticles adsorbing at flat{,} horizontal buried water-n-decane interfaces.

We investigate in particular the effect of varying polymer molecular weights (2-5 kDa) and architectures (linear vs. dendritic) on the self-assembly process and the final structure of the interfacially adsorbed NP monolayers. Linear PEG particles adsorb more rapidly than dendritic PEG ones and reach full interface coverage and stable NP monolayer structure{,} while dendritic PEG particles undergo a slower adsorption process{,} which is not completed within the experimental time window of [similar]6 hours. All NPs are highly hydrophilic with effective contact angles that depend weakly on PEG molecular weight and architecture. Conversely{,} the in-plane NP separation depends strongly on PEG molecular weight. The measured inter-particle separation at full interface coverage yields low iron oxide core content{,} indicating a strong deformation and flattening of the linear PEG shell at the interface.

	Abstract = {Abstract We investigate the structural chain-to-ring transition at low temperature in a gas of dipolar hard spheres (DHS). Due to the weakening of entropic contribution, ring formation becomes noticeable when the effective dipole-dipole magnetic interaction increases. It results in the redistribution of particles from usually observed flexible chains into flexible rings. The concentration (r) of \{DHS\} plays a crucial part in this transition: at a very low ρ only chains and rings are observed, whereas even a slight increase of the volume fraction leads to the formation of branched or defect structures. As a result, the fraction of \{DHS\} aggregated in defect-free rings turns out to be a non-monotonic function of r. The average ring size is found to be a slower increasing function of r when compared to that of chains. Both theory and computer simulations confirm the dramatic influence of the ring formation on the ρ-dependence of the initial magnetic susceptibility (chi) when the temperature decreases. The rings due to their zero total dipole moment are irresponsive to a weak magnetic field and drive to the strong decrease of the initial magnetic susceptibility.},

	Abstract = {The theory of particle association in chains in dilute ferrofluids and dipole fluids is generalized to the case of polydisperse systems. The chains could be formed by ferroparticles of different sizes, so various types of chain aggregates are considered. The probabilities of chain structure appearance are calculated, and the phase diagram, allowing to find the most probable structure with only the continuous particle size distribution known, is built. Our results demonstrate that in spite of a very weak dipole-dipole interaction between the small size fraction particles, their presence exerts a decisive influence on the ferrofluid microstructure. The chain shortening caused by the small particles sticking to the edges of chains formed by large particles is discovered theoretically. The latter effect is proved to exist by the recent computer simulations on bidisperse ferrofluid makeup. The application of the developed model to the description of magnetic birefringence phenomena in weak external magnetic fields shows a very good agreement with experimental data.},

To check for consistency, extensive molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations are performed on systems with discretized versions of p(x) corresponding as closely as possible to that of the real ferrofluid. Essentially perfect agreement between experiment, theory, and computer simulation is demonstrated.

At high values of w these two transitions change into a single transition from an adsorbed coil to a cylinder-like liquid-crystalline solid globule.

We present the diagram of states for semiflexible chains consisting of N = 64 and 128 monomer units as a function of temperature T and strength of the adsorption potential, εw, and also compare this with the diagram of states for flexible chains of these two lengths. The diagram of states consists of the regions of a coil, liquid globule, solid isotropic globule, adsorbed coil, and quasi-two-dimensional solid globule with nematic bond order (or quasi-two-dimensional isotropic crystal in the case of a flexible chain). The diagram of states for the flexible case agrees with a result for the same model and a short-ranged attraction to the wall for small values of the attraction strength. For larger values, the transition to the two-dimensional behavior is more gradual in the long-ranged attractive potential. For the range of chain stiffness that we studied, the low-temperature phase in the bulk is an isotropic globule (i.e., a globule without bond order). At the attractive surface, a nematic-type bond order is induced upon adsorption, leading to ordered structures, which can be considered a precursor to the crystalline lamellae forming in real polymers. Other than that, the diagram of states in general is not changed by introducing stiffness of the chains.},

Chains of length up to 200 monomer units were simulated. For the flexible case these chains are long enough to determine the -temperature, but for higher stiffnesses we show systematic effects in the dependence of the apparent transition temperature on the stiffness. For fixed chain lengths we determine apparent phase diagrams and give the apparent transition points and points of ideal chain size as a function of stiffness.

	Abstract = {Potential of mean force calculations along a reaction coordinate (RC) demand exhaustive sampling, which often leads to prohibitively long computational times. The expanded ensemble density of states (EXEDOS) [ E. B. Kim, R. Faller, Q. Yan et al., J. Chem. Phys. 117, 7781 (2002) ] is a simple flat-histogram Monte Carlo method based on the density of states algorithm proposed by Wang and Landau [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 2050 (2001) ]. EXEDOS offers the advantage of continuous uniform sampling of the RC with no a priori knowledge of the free energy profile. However, the method is not certain to converge within accessible simulation time. Furthermore, the strongly asymmetric distribution of tunneling times inherent in flat-histogram sampling imposes additional limitations. We propose several improvements that accelerate the EXEDOS method and can be generally applicable in free energy calculations. First, we propose an asynchronous parallel implementation of the density of states algorithm in a multiple-walkers multiple-windows scheme and extend the algorithm in an expanded ensemble [(MW)2-XDOS] for PMF calculations as the original EXEDOS. Despite the nonideal scaling over a number of processors this technique overcomes limitations by extreme values of tunneling times and allows consistent evaluations of performance. The second set of improvements addresses the dependence of convergence times on system size, density, and sampling rate of the RC. At low densities, the coupling of (MW)2-XDOS with the rejection-free geometric cluster move provides impressive performance that overshadows any other technique. However, the limited applicability of cluster moves at high densities requires an alternative approach. We propose the coupling of (MW)2-XDOS with preferential sampling methods. In the systems studied, single displacements in the proximity of particles defining the RC accelerate calculations significantly and render the simulation nearly size-independent. A further modification of preferential sampling involves collective displacements of particles performed in a ``smart Monte Carlo'' scheme. This ``local Brownian dynamics'' algorithm can be generally applicable to many free energy simulation methods and would be particularly beneficial at high densities and molecular systems with strong intramolecular potentials.},

RCP poly(styrene-co-4-bromostyrene) (PBrxS), where x denotes the mole fraction of 4-bromostryrene (4-BrS), is prepared by bromination of parent homopolystyrene. By varying the solvent quality during the bromination, either ``truly random'' (good solvent) or ``random-blocky'' (poor solvent) PBrxS RCPs are prepared. Adsorption studies of PBrxS from various solvents at silica surfaces reveal that the adsorption of PBrxS increases with (1) increasing blockiness of the macromolecule, (2) increasing content of 4-BrS in PBrxS, and (3) decreasing solvent quality. Additionally, the effect of comonomer sequence distribution on RCP adsorption is modeled in detail using a coarse-grained statistical mechanical model and fully atomistic simulations based on configurational-biased grand-canonical Monte Carlo (CB-GCMC) technique. The main result from the simulations can be summarized as follows: (1) Increasing the degree of ``blockiness'' in comonomer distribution enhances the adsorption of macromolecules dissolved in a good solvent. (2) Near the adsorption transition, the amount of adsorbed segments in ``random-blocky'' copolymers is larger relative to their regular multiblock counterparts. (3) Lowering the solvent quality facilitates copolymer adsorption. Overall, the findings from computer modeling are found to be in a good agreement with the experimental data.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics of adsorption and desorption of uncharged homopolymers have been investigated using a coarse-grained model comprised of a bead−spring chain and a planar surface. Brownian dynamics simulation has been used to examine the adsorption process for polymers released near the surface and with bulk properties as well as Monte Carlo simulations to explore equilibrium adsorption structures of the polymer. Systems with varying polymer contour length, polymer stiffness, and polymer−surface interaction potential have been considered. Investigations have been made on polymer extensions perpendicular and parallel to the surface and also characterized the adsorbed state in terms of loops, tails, and trains. After a diffusion of the polymer to the vicinity of the surface, three succeeding phases were identified: distortion, attachment, and relaxation phase. In the distortion phase, the polymer starts to experience the potential of the surface and becomes elongated perpendicular to the surface. In the attachment phase, the polymer makes direct contact with the surface and becomes contracted perpendicular to the surface and starts to spread on the surface. Finally, in the extended relaxation phase, the polymer continues to spread on the surface.},

Approximations based on the charge picture shed light on the influence of the Coulomb-like interactions on the structure of nanopore water.

	Abstract = {It is easy to find a wide variety of applications for magnetism in human life when we take a glance at our surroundings. One of the first applications of magnets began with the mariner's compass. Since the invention of the compass, magnets have been widely used by humans; effective development in the applications for magnets has provided generators, electric motors, magnetic tapes, and so on, all of which contribute to much of our wealth and happiness. Highly magnetic compounds (i.e., ferro- and ferrimagnetic) are ascribed to the spin-containing molecules in which the magnetic sites are the d- or f-orbitals of the transition, lanthanide, or actinide metals. Synthetic organic polymers have been practically applied to magnetic materials, such as a magnetic gum and magnetic tapes. These materials were made by dispersing an inorganic magnetic substance in a synthetic rubber, or by kinking ferrite onto a polymer film, but these polymers are not themselves magnetic substances. Generally, organic compounds have no unpaired electrons, except for the free radicals and carbenes, which are unstable at room temperature. Accordingly, organic compounds have not been of interest as magnetic materials, although there have been a few papers that pointed out the theoretical possibility of ferromagnetic organic compounds. Organic polymers containing paramagnetic species have been of interest for use as conducting materials, redox resins, and antioxidants.1-4 To my knowledge, no systematic study of magnetic properties of these polymers had been carried out before we began investigating polymers with stable radicals in their side chains.5-6 In 1984, several polycarbenes were prepared by the in situ photolysis of polydiazo derivatives.[7] The magnetic susceptibility measurements of these polycarbenes showed that the polycarbenes have the highest possible spin multiplicities in the ground state. For example, tetracarbenes have very large magnetic moments with nonet (S = 8/2). Moreover, in 1986, the first organic ferromagnet was reported by Ovchinnikov and his colleagues in the Soviet Union.[8] These molecular-based magnetic properties were ascribed to interactions of the p-electrons of C, O, and N. This is different from magnetism in conventional atom-based and d-f electron inorganic materials, and revealed the possibility of magnetic materials associated only with organic compounds. The magnetic properties can be modulated by flexible organic synthetic methods, which may expand the range of the potential application. These magnetic polymers suggest the possibilities of new types of functional polymers. Accordingly, much more attention has been paid to the preparation of high-spin polymers, and some of them have been ferromagnetic. This chapter surveys the research trends pertaining to polymers for magnetism.},

	Abstract = {Recently, the role of hydrodynamic interactions in the selection of a kinetic pathway for phase transitions has attracted considerable attention. Here we study this problem numerically by taking as an example a coil-globule transition of a single polymer, which is a prototype model of protein folding. When a swollen polymer collapses into a globule state, hydrodynamic interactions accelerate the transition. We find, on the other hand, that when a rather compact polymer collapses into the same final state, hydrodynamic interactions decelerate the transition due to a slow squeezing process of the solvent. We reveal that the degree of the initial enhancement of anisotropy of the polymer configuration determines whether hydrodynamic interactions accelerate or decelerate the collapsing dynamics. We also discuss the possible relevance of squeezing flow effects in protein folding.},

	Abstract = {We try to elucidate the microstructure formation in a monodisperse ferrofluid monolayer. The system under study consists of soft sphere magnetic dipolar particles confined to a thin fluid layer. The positions of the particles are constrained to a 2D geometry, whereas the particle magnetic dipole moments are not fixed to the body systems, and are free to rotate in 3 dimensions, hence forming in what we call a quasi-2D geometry. Using a combination of analytical density functional theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find that for the studied range of parameters the majority of aggregates might be divided into two types: chains and rings. Their sizes and area fractions are strongly influenced by the geometrical constraints. We show that for quasi-2D systems the excluded area effects play one of the most important parts in the microstructure formation. The simulation technique and the theoretical model put forward in the present paper agree qualitatively with the results of recent in situ observations of the microstructures observed in ferrofluid monolayers [M.

The proposed parameter-free theory is able to capture both the density and temperature dependence of the ring-chain equilibrium and the contribution to the susceptibility of a chain of generic length. The theory predicts a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the initial (zero field) magnetic susceptibility, arising from the competition between magnetically inert particle rings and magnetically active chains.

In order to calculate the structure factor analytically{,} we first derive the radial distribution function. For that we use the combination of the density functional theory and density expansion of the pair correlation functions. The first theory allows for the equilibrium chain formation{,} and the second takes into account particles{'} shape anisotropy at the level of the Gay-Berne potential. We apply our method to describe centre-centre structure factors of self-assembling short DNA duplexes with various semiaxes ratios. Extensive comparison of the theoretical predictions with the Monte Carlo simulation data shows a very good agreement.

	Abstract = {In the first part of the present contribution we study theoretically the ground states of magnetic rods and ellipsoids with point dipoles. We consider two different orientations of dipoles: the dipole moment oriented along the short axis of the anisotropic particle and the dipole moment aligned along the long axis. We show that depending on the particle asphericity the ground states of ellipsoids and rods might be a chain and a ring (daisy) in two dimensions{,} or a carpet and a bracelet in three dimensions. If the ellipsoids or rods with the dipole moment coaligned with the long axis are elongated enough{,} the head-to-tail configuration of moments becomes less favourable than the antiparallel side-by-side pair of dipoles. This structural crossover in the ground state drives crucial changes in the microstructure of systems of anisotropic particles when the thermal energy starts being comparable to that of the interparticle interaction. We investigate the latter regime in the second part of our manuscript and provide a detailed analysis of the interparticle correlations using molecular dynamics simulations. We extensively study the influence of aspect ratios and different dipolar strengths on the structural properties{,} internal pressure and initial susceptibility of anisotropic particles{'} systems. We conclude that the particle shape anisotropy could be effectively used as a control parameter for the system microstructure.},

	Abstract = {In the past decades, ferrofluids have become relevant in many applications ranging from engineering to medicine, and have attracted the interest of scientists from many fields. To understand the physical mechanisms serving as a basis for these applications, over the last decades, many of the properties of ferrofluids have been studied and can now be controlled. However, in order to fine-tune various aspects of the interactions in the system and hopefully - in the long run - to build tailored structures, in recent years, magnetic nanoparticles and colloids that deviate from the model of a spherical particle with a dipole moment at its center were examined. Among them are dumbbells, magnetic core-shell particles, elongated ferro-particles, and colloidal particles with a magnetic cap. In this paper, we introduce and examine - using analytical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations - one such model system, namely, magnetic particles in which the dipole moment is shifted from the center of mass towards the particle's surface. In this way, an additional anisotropy is introduced to the particles, which results in quite different and surprising microscopic properties of suspensions. Here, we mainly concentrate on ground states of small clusters of shifted-dipole particles, but also take a first glance on suspensions at finite temperature.},

Small clusters help us to get an insight into the inter-particle interactions and form a building block for studies of larger systems. Without external magnetic field, the ground state structure changes from chains and rings with parallel alignment of moments, usually observed in dipolar particles (Prokopieva et al., 2009 [1]), to pairs and triangles with close to anti-parallel orientation of moments, when the shift of the dipole is increased.

	Abstract = {Brushes of end-grafted, polar polymer chains in a good, nonpolar solvent are studied via molecular dynamics simulations of a bead-spring model. The monomers are connected by finitely extensible nonlinear springs. The springs connecting consecutive monomers in a chain are labeled with dipoles parallel to the chain contour. We consider the dipoles as limits of charge pairs, replacing each dipole by a pair of charges positioned at the centers of mass of two consecutive beads. Equilibrium simulations are performed, and the static and dynamic properties of the chains are related to the dipole magnitude. It was found that the electrostatic interactions lead to a shorter brush and the collapse becomes more pronounced with increasing segmental dipole moment. The dielectric relaxation of the tethered chains is studied, and the dielectric permittivity is obtained from equilibrium dipole moment correlation functions. Results on the dielectric relaxation of tethered chains from experiments conducted by Yao et al. exhibited a broader dielectric dispersion spectrum than that of free macromolecules in homogeneous solutions. These authors attributed the results to the thermodynamic confinement (to keep uniform segment density) and the spatial confinement that prohibits a chain to cross the tethering domain boundary. The simulations indicate that neither the spatial confinement nor the thermodynamic confinement lead to a broader dielectric dispersion spectrum for the tethered chains, and we attribute the discrepancies to the morphology differences between the experimental system and the simulated one. Weak electric fields parallel and perpendicular to the grafting surface are applied, and the system response is related to the equilibrium fluctuations. We also examine the structural properties of the brushes at steady state under the influence of external electric fields.},

This versatile synthetic method enabled the production of multigram quantities of these polymeric surfactants that stabilized ferromagnetic CoNPs when dispersed in organic media. An in-depth investigation into the synthesis of polystyrene-coated ferromagnetic CoNPs was also conducted using various combinations of these polymeric surfactants in the thermolysis of dicobaltoctacarbonyl (Co2(CO)8). Moreover, the application of a dual-stage thermolysis with Co2(CO)8 allowed for the preparation of large samples (200--820 mg) per batch of well-defined and dispersable ferromagnetic nanoparticles. Characterization of these functionalized nanoparticle materials was then done using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, vibrating sample magnetometry, and thermogravimetric analysis. Self-assembly of these dipolar nanoparticles was investigated in solutions cast onto supporting substrates, where local nematic-like ordering of nanoparticle chains was observed along with a tendency of adjacent chains to form ``zippering'' configurations, both phenomena having been predicted by recent simulations of dipolar fluids in conjunction with van der Waals interactions.},

The elastic and magnetic properties of the cilia are obtained by fitting the results of the computational model to the experimental data. The performance of the artificial cilia with a non-uniform cross-section is characterised using the numerical model for two channel configurations that are of practical importance: an open-loop and a closed-loop channel. We predict that the flow and pressure head generated by the artificial cilia can be as high as 18 microlitres per minute and 3 mm of water{,} respectively. We also study the effect of metachronal waves on the flow generated and show that the fluid propelled increases drastically compared to synchronously beating cilia{,} and is unidirectional. This increase is significant even when the phase difference between adjacent cilia is small. The obtained results provide guidelines for the optimal design of magnetically-driven artificial cilia for microfluidic propulsion.},

	Abstract = {Natural cilia are hairlike microtubule-based structures that are able to move fluid on the micrometer scale using asymmetric motion. In this article, we follow a biomimetic approach to design artificial cilia lining the inner surfaces of microfluidic channels with the goal of propelling fluid. The artificial cilia consist of polymer films filled with superparamagnetic nanoparticles, which can mimic the motion of natural cilia when subjected to a rotating magnetic field. To obtain the magnetic field and associated magnetization local to the cilia, we solve the Maxwell equations, from which the magnetic body moments and forces can be deduced. To obtain the ciliary motion, we solve the dynamic equations of motion, which are then fully coupled to the Navier--Stokes equations that describe the fluid flow around the cilia, thus taking full account of fluid inertial forces. The dimensionless parameters that govern the deformation behavior of the cilia and the associated fluid flow are arrived at using the principle of virtual work. The physical response of the cilia and the fluid flow for different combinations of elastic, fluid viscous, and inertia forces are identified.},

Here we investigate the mechanical properties of such a chain, in particular the bending stiffness. We determine the contribution of magnetic interactions to the bending stiffness and the persistence length of the chain. This contribution is comparable to, but typically smaller than the contribution of the semiflexible filament. For a chain of magnetic nanoparticles without a semiflexible filament, the linear configuration is typically metastable and the lowest energy structures are closed chains (flux closure rings) without a net magnetic moment that are thus not functional as a cellular compass. Our calculations show that the presence of the cytoskeletal filament stabilizes the chain against ring closure, either thermodynamically or kinetically, depending on the stiffness of the filament, confirming that such stabilization is one of the roles of this structure in these bacterial cells.},

Further topics concern the effect of quenched positional disorder, the influence of external (electric or magnetic) fields, and the fluid--fluid phase behaviour of various dipolar mixtures.

Two possible onion states, forward or reverse magnetized, are possible for a given direction of the magnetic field. Going from the forward or the backward onion state, both local scanning Kerr microscopy measurements and micromagnetic simulations show that the clockwise or the counterclockwise vortex state, respectively, can be selected due to asymmetric pinning of the two domain walls that are present in the onion state.},

This additionally introduced anisotropy in the system strongly affects the topology of clusters at both low and finite temperatures. In the ground state in the intermediate dipolar shift range the dimensionality plays a role due to possibilities for decreasing the inter-dipolar distance. For larger shifts{,} the dimensionality of the system practically does not influence the ground state energy{,} but the clusters can still differ in Q2D and 3D. It turns out that at finite temperature the average cluster size changes nonmonotonously with increase in the dipolar moment shift both in quasi 2D and 3D: it first increases{,} but when the dipolar moment is shifted by more than 50\% from the centre{,} the cluster size starts decreasing fast and reaches unity.

Here we report linear solution-based self-assembly of metal nanocubes (NCs), examine the structural characteristics of the NC chains, and demonstrate their advanced optical characteristics. In comparison with chains of nanospheres with similar dimensions, composition, and surface chemistry, predominant face-to-face assembly of large NCs coated with short polymer ligands led to a larger volume of hot spots in the chains, a nearly uniform E-field enhancement in the gaps between colinear NCs, and a new coupling mode for NC chains due to the formation of a Fabry--Perot resonator structure formed by face-to-face bonded NCs. The NC chains exhibited stronger surface-enhanced Raman scattering in comparison with linear assemblies of nanospheres. The experimental results were in agreement with finite difference time domain simulations. },

We consider the case where the copolymers do not display phase segregation behavior in the bulk but the surface is strongly selective for the A-component and the probability of finding an A-monomer along the chain is p<<1. Using self-consistent field theory and scaling arguments, we discuss some aspects of conformational rearrangements and composition selection in the surface layer. For strong selectivity we discuss the formation of a polydisperse brush on the surface. Next, we consider selection mechanisms of chains and sequences of A-species in the surface layer. We used the bond-fluctuation method to simulate copolymer melts at different values of the surface selectivity. Several aspects of the surface layer are analyzed, such as the composition profiles, chemical composition of chains on the surface, chain extension, and dynamics. We find evidence for conformational rearrangements in the surface layer according to the polydisperse brush model, as well as enrichment of A-monomers in the adosorbed chains, stretching of chains in the direction perpendicular to the surface, and selection of multiple A-sequences. Slight but systematic variation of the properties of surface layer at long simulation times indicates that selection processes require very long time scales as expected from theoretical arguments.},

	Abstract = {Magnetotactic bacteria precipitate intracellular crystals of single-domain magnetite (Fe3O4) and/or greigite (Fe3S4), which have often been implicated in carrying the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of freshwater and marine sediments. In vivo, the magnetic crystals are usually aligned in chains such that their moments add together, generating net cellular moments high enough to rotate the cells passively to align with the geomagnetic field. A magnetostatic/biophysical analysis demonstrates that this arrangement is out of dynamic equilibrium and would collapse spontaneously without a support mechanism. Past rock magnetic analyses of shallow water marine carbonates suggest that partial collapse does occur during diagenesis and dolomitization. To calibrate this effect we induced magnetosome chain collapse in Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum strain MS-1 by progressive sonification and treatment with detergents and monitored the changes with rock magnetic analysis and TEM. Although it has been speculated that the cell wall and associated membrane structures act to prevent magnetosome chain collapse, our data indicate that magnetosome linearity persists long after cells are disrupted. This is consistent with prior observations that in some magnetotcocci the magnetosome chains pass through the cell interior, precluding continuous contact with the cell wall and implying additional support structures exist in some species. Using TEM tomographic reconstructions prepared with a magnetic technique that prevents chain collapse, we examined the three dimensional ultrastructure of magnetosomes without the problem of post-mortem magnetosome motion. This method revealed the presence of an intracellular organic sheath beyond that of actin-like filaments reported recently that follows the chain of magnetosomes, which we postulate evolved to hold the crystals in place and enhances their ability to preserve NRM in sediments. As the genomes of two magnetotactic bacteria contain several apparent homologues of known eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins, natural selection for magnetotaxis may have played a role in the evolution of precursors to the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. The presence of this sheath is also consistent with the observation of electron translucent material associated with putative magnetofossil chains in ALH84001.},

These polymer-coated colloids assembled into robust, micron-sized nanoparticle chains when cast onto supporting surfaces due to dipolar associations of magnetic cores. Hierarchical assemblies were also prepared by blending polystyrene-coated cobalt colloids with larger silica beads.},

Changing the cation species in oleic acid salts allows different degrees of dissociation at high temperatures to be obtained, resulting in various stabilizer performances: Sodium oleate as stabilizer results in monodisperse iron oxide nanocrystals of cubic shape with precisely adjustable edge lengths between 7 and 23 nm. Dibutylammonium oleate and oleic acid, in contrast, induce growth of spherical nanocrystals in the same size range. Further adjustment of the growth conditions leads to {100}-bound bipyramidal nanocrystals with a single, (111) oriented twin plane. While the nanocrystal size is related to their superparamagnetic blocking temperature, the shape influences their magnetization hysteresis properties observed at low temperatures.},

The chain is composed of mass points interacting via a truncated Lennard-Jones potential, i.e., the excluded volume interaction is taken into account, and grafted to the surface with one end. The average adsorption degree is calculated for various chain lengths (N = 16, 32, 64, 128) and adsorption energies. In addition, the scaling behavior of the adsorption degree and the radius of gyration is investigated. The adsorption degree and the average length of loops and tails are obtained for chains of various stiffnesses. In this context, we find that stiffer chains adsorb more easily. Moreover, the distribution of the mass points perpendicular to the surface as well as the orientation of the bonds with respect to the surface is discussed for various adsorption energies and stiffnesses.},

	Abstract = {When deposited from an evaporating solution onto a substrate, even nondescript nanoparticles can organize into intricate spatial patterns. Here we show that a simple but long-ranged anisotropy in nanoparticles' interactions can greatly enrich this scenario. In experiments with colloidal Co nanocrystals, which bear a substantial magnetic dipole, we observe assemblies quite distinct from those formed by nonmagnetic particles. Reflecting the strongly nonequilibrium nature of this process, nanocrystal aggregates also differ substantially from expected low-energy arrangements. Using coarse-grained computer simulations of dipolar nanoparticles, we have identified several dynamical mechanisms from which such unusual morphologies can arise. For particles with modest dipole moments, transient connections between growing domains frustrate phase separation into sparse and dense regions on the substrate. Characteristic length scales of the resulting cellular networks depend non-monotonically on the depth of quenches we use to mimic the effects of solvent evaporation. For particles with strong dipole moments, chain-like aggregates formed at early times serve as the agents of assembly at larger scales. Their effective interactions drive the formation of layered loop structures similar to those observed in experiments.},

This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori.

	Abstract = {The Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM), an extension of Ferrenberg and Swendsen's Multiple Histogram Technique, has been applied for the first time on complex biomolecular Hamiltonians. The method is presented here as an extension of the Umbrella Sampling method for free-energy and Potential of Mean Force calculations. This algorithm possesses the following advantages over methods that are currently employed: (1) It provides a built-in estimate of sampling errors thereby yielding objective estimates of the optimal location and length of additional simulations needed to achieve a desired level of precision; (2) it yields the ``best'' value of free energies by taking into account all the simulations so as to minimize the statistical errors; (3) in addition to optimizing the links between simulations, it also allows multiple overlaps of probability distributions for obtaining better estimates of the free-energy differences. By recasting the Ferrenberg--Swendsen Multiple Histogram equations in a form suitable for molecular mechanics type Hamiltonians, we have demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of this method by applying it to a test problem of the generation of the Potential of Mean Force profile of the pseudorotation phase angle of the sugar ring in deoxyadenosine. {\copyright} 1992 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

Superparamagnetic colloidal particles form monolayers when they are confined to a air-water interface in a hanging water droplet. An external magnetic field allows us to tune the strength of the mutual dipole-dipole interaction between the colloids and the anisotropy of the interaction can be controlled by the tilt angle of the magnetic field relative to the surface normal of the air-water interface. For sufficiently large magnetic field strength crystalline monolayers are found. The role of fluctuations in these two-dimensional crystals is discussed. Furthermore, clustering phenomena in binary mixtures of superparamagnetic particles forming fluid monolayers are predicted. Finally, we address sheared colloidal bilayers and find that the orientation of confined colloidal crystals can be tailored by a previously applied shear direction.},

	Abstract = {A polymer chain under good solvent condition near a short-range attractive impenetrable wall (xy plane) is investigated by dynamic Monte Carlo simulation using the bond-fluctuation model. For the statics, the adsorption transition is clearly observed and the adsorption transition temperature, Ta for this model is determined. Chain conformation, segment orientation, fraction of segment adsorbed, chain dimensions, and layer thickness as a function of temperature and distance away from the wall are studied and discussed. Our results for the scaling behavior of the radii of gyration and fraction of segment adsorbed confirm previous analytical theories and static simulation results. We also obtain an estimate for the critical exponent which is consistent with previous static simulations of self-avoiding walks. Furthermore, our data on specific heat show another peak, apart from the one at Ta, at a temperature T2 distinctively below Ta, suggesting a second transition. As for the dynamics, both the time autocorrelation function and the time dependence of the mean square displacement of the center of mass of the chain are studied. We find that the time autocorrelation function in the adsorbed state can be fitted to a stretched exponential form and the relaxation time starts to diverge for temperatures below T2. The diffusion coefficients for motions parallel (Dz) and perpendicular (D⊥) to the z axis are also extracted. Dz shows a sharp drop as the temperature is lowered below the adsorption transition temperature while D⊥ remains constant until around T2 at which it decreases abruptly. Furthermore we also observe that the lateral diffusion (D⊥) crosses over from a Rouse behavior (D⊥∼N-1) to a D⊥∼N-2 behavior for temperatures below T2. These results are discussed in terms of the appropriate scaling theories.},

Thermodynamic properties can be determined from suitable derivatives of the partition function and, unlike ``standard'' methods, the free energy and entropy can also be computed directly.

	Abstract = {verall rotational anisotropy is found to be generic in compact clusters of model dipolar particles. This broken rotational symmetry, or ``global'' orientational order, is pronounced in zero temperature configurations. It arises from the tendency of dipolar particles to form head‐to‐tail chains which encircle the cluster, giving rise to a circulating pattern. In many cases, the zero temperature arrangement of dipolar particles is chiral. Expansion of the dipole density field in vector spherical harmonics provides order parameters to quantify broken orientational symmetry, and facilitates analysis of inversion and reflection symmetry. Finite temperature simulations of a 13‐particle cluster with Stockmayer (Lennard‐Jones+point dipole) interactions indicates that the global orientational order persists to higher temperatures, even above the point of translational melting. The 13‐particle Stockmayer cluster remains orientationally ordered up to the onset of frequent evaporation from the cluster. Ramifications of this effect are discussed.},

Our simulations did not give any evidence that these ``polymerlike'' systems phase separate into a liquid and vapor phase.},

The bending rigidity{,} or persistence length{,} of these chains can be determined by monitoring the thermal fluctuations of the chains.

	Abstract = {X-ray scattering is a structural characterization tool that has impacted diverse fields of study. It is unique in its ability to examine materials in real time and under realistic sample environments, enabling researchers to understand morphology at nanometer and angstrom length scales using complementary small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS, WAXS), respectively. Herein, we focus on the use of SAXS to examine nanoscale particulate systems. We provide a theoretical foundation for X-ray scattering, considering both form factor and structure factor, as well as the use of correlation functions, which may be used to determine a particle's size, size distribution, shape, and organization into hierarchical structures. The theory is expanded upon with contemporary use cases. Both transmission and reflection (grazing incidence) geometries are addressed, as well as the combination of SAXS with other X-ray and non-X-ray characterization tools. We conclude with an examination of several key areas of research where X-ray scattering has played a pivotal role, including in situ nanoparticle synthesis, nanoparticle assembly, and operando studies of catalysts and energy storage materials. Throughout this review we highlight the unique capabilities of X-ray scattering for structural characterization of materials in their native environment.},

The latter are macromolecular entities with typical sizes ranging from 1 nm to 1 micron and their suspension typically contain, in addition to the solvent, smaller components such as salt ions or free polymer chains. The theoretical tool introduced is the effective Hamiltonian which formally results by a canonical trace over the smaller degrees of freedom for a fixed, frozen configuration of the large ones. After presenting the formal definitions of this effective Hamiltonian, we proceed with the applications to some common soft matter systems having a variable softness and ranging from free polymer chains to hard colloidal particles. We begin from the extreme case of nondiverging effective interactions between ultrasoft polymer chains and derive an exact criterion to determine the topology of the phase diagrams of such systems. We use star polymers with a variable arm number f as a hybrid system in order to interpolate between these two extremes. By deriving an effective interaction between stars we can monitor the change in the phase behavior of a system as the steepness of the repulsion between its constituent particles increases. We also review recent results on the nature and the effects of short-range attractions on the phase diagrams of spherical, nonoverlapping colloidal particles.},

For homopolymer chains, we have considered both good and poor solvent conditions, and for copolymer chains, we have considered several conformations of the non-adsorbing monomers. Our results indicate that when the adsorption strength is strong enough, a scaling description of the adsorption kinetics works well for homopolymers in both good and poor solvent conditions. When the adsorption strength is not strong enough, the chains adsorb partially, and one needs to consider effects of this partial adsorption in the scaling description. For each of the three primary structures of the copolymers considered in this study, the polymer chain does get adsorbed to the surface but the kinetics of the adsorption process depends on the specific structures of the copolymer chains.},

The numerical results of the intramolecular correlation function, the radius of gyration, and the characteristic ratio of a polymer chain are indicative of conformational changes from one environment to another and are in agreement with other findings in the literature. Scaling laws for the chain size with respect to the number of monomers are discussed. We show results for the intra- and intermolecular correlation functions and the medium-induced potential. We also extract the Kuhn length and the characteristic ratio for the infinite chain limit for melts. The latter is compared to the experimental results and computer simulation. The conformational free energy per monomer in different solvents is calculated.

	Abstract = {Using a simple thermodynamic model, we derive an expression for the excluded volume parameter v of a polymer chain in a symmetric solvent (solvated by its own monomers). For a chain with a given segment length and number of monomers, this parameter determines whether the chain is collapsed or expanded. For the latter it determines the degree of expansion. Using a simple off-lattice version of Flory's model [ P. J. Flory, Principles of Polymer Chemistry (Cornell University Press, Ithaca, 1953) ] and relaxing the assumption of incompressibility, we obtain the result v = (1−κ)/ρ0, where κ is the dimensionless compressibility and ρ0 the number density of solvent. In the incompressible limit (in the sense that κ→0) the chain is expanded and the inverse of the solvent number density determines the degree of expansion of the chain. Using the van der Waals equation of state to estimate κ (allowing for nonzero compressibility in a system that can undergo a gas-liquid phase transition), the model predicts that upon raising the temperature at constant pressure there is both a lower (coil to globule) and upper (globule to coil) Flory temperature. This is in quantitative agreement with experiment and computer simulations.},

	Abstract = {A polymer chain tethered to a surface may be compact or extended, adsorbed or desorbed, depending on interactions with the surface and the surrounding solvent. This leads to a rich phase diagram with a variety of transitions. To investigate these transitions we have performed Monte Carlo simulations of a bond fluctuation model with Wang--Landau and umbrella sampling algorithms in a two-dimensional state space. The simulations' density-of-states results have been evaluated for interaction parameters spanning the range from good- to poor-solvent conditions and from repulsive to strongly attractive surfaces. In this work, we describe the simulation method and present results for the overall phase behavior and for some of the transitions. For adsorption in good solvent, we compare with Metropolis Monte Carlo data for the same model and find good agreement between the results. For the collapse transition, which occurs when the solvent quality changes from good to poor, we consider two situations corresponding to three-dimensional (hard surface) and two-dimensional (very attractive surface) chain conformations, respectively. For the hard surface, we compare tethered chains with free chains and find very similar behavior for both types of chains. For the very attractive surface, we find the two-dimensional chain collapse to be a two-step transition with the same sequence of transitions that is observed for three-dimensional chains: a coil-globule transition that changes the overall chain size is followed by a local rearrangement of chain segments.},

	Abstract = {Brownian dynamics simulations are used to investigate the dynamics of orientational properties of real charge-stabilized ferrofluids, i.e. stable colloidal dispersions of magnetic nanoparticles. The relaxation times of the magnetization and of the birefringence, data accessible by experimental techniques, have been computed at several volume fractions. Besides, the effect of hydrodynamic interactions has been investigated. Equilibrium simulations without field are found to be inadequate to determine the aforementioned relaxation times for the systems under study, the dipolar interaction being too weak. Thus a nonequilibrium simulation procedure that mimics the experimental operating mode has been developed. After equilibrium simulations under a magnetic field, both birefringence and magnetization decays are recorded once the field is suppressed. Birefringence and magnetization decays are markedly impeded as the volume fraction increases, whereas they are barely enhanced when the intensity of the initial magnetic field is increased at a fixed volume fraction. Eventually, hydrodynamic interactions exhibit a slight but systematic lengthening of the relaxation times.},

Apart from the main phases of adsorbed and desorbed conformations, we identify several other phase transitions such as the freezing transition between energy-dominated crystalline low-temperature structures and globular entropy-dominated conformations.},

Strong magnetic dipole interactions between ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic particles, that would be superparamagnetic if isolated, can result in a collective state of nanoparticles. This collective state has many similarities to spin-glasses. In samples of aggregated magnetic nanoparticles, exchange interactions are often important and this can also lead to a strong suppression of superparamagnetic relaxation. The temperature dependence of the order parameter in samples of strongly interacting hematite nanoparticles or goethite grains is well described by a simple mean field model. Exchange interactions between nanoparticles with different orientations of the easy axes can also result in a rotation of the sub-lattice magnetization directions.},

In the chain-collapse process after a quench from the θ temperature to a temperature T1, the temperature was changed from T1 to T2 at the time t1 after the quench and returned to T1 at the time t1+t2. In the three stages at T1, T2, and T1, measurements of the mean-square radius of gyration of polymer chains were carried out by static light scattering and the chain-collapse process was represented by the expansion factor as a function of time. An effect of chain aggregation on the measurements was negligibly small because of the very slow phase separation. For the negative temperature perturbation (T1>T2), the chain-collapse processes observed in the first and third stages were connected smoothly and agreed with the collapse process due to a single-stage quench to T1. A memory of the chain collapse in the first stage at T1 was found to persist into the third stage at the same temperature T1 without being affected by the temperature perturbation of T2 during t2. The memory effect was observed irrespective of the time period of t2. The positive temperature perturbation (T1<T2) showed an acceleration of the chain-collapse process.},

The chains are represented as self-avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice with a nearest-neighbor contact potential to model the effect of solvent quality. The knot state of the chains is determined using the knot group procedure presented in the accompanying paper. The equilibrium knot spectrum and the equilibrium rms radius of gyration as functions of the chain length and the contact potential are reported. The collapse transition was studied following quenches from good-to poor-solvent conditions. Our results confirm the prediction that the newly formed globule is not yet at equilibrium, since it has not yet achieved its equilibrium knot spectrum. For our model system, the relaxation of the knot spectrum is about an order of magnitude slower than that of the radius of gyration. The collapse transition is also studied for a model in which both ends of the chain remain in good-solvent conditions. Over the time scale of these simulations, knot formation is frustrated in this inhomogeneous model, verifying that the mechanism of knotting is the tunneling of chain ends in and out of the globule.},

	Abstract = {In order to form magnetic filaments or chains, aqueous suspensions of superparamagnetic colloidal particles were aggregated under the action of an external magnetic field in the presence of different amounts of an indifferent 1:1 electrolyte (KBr). This allowed the influence of the anisotropic magnetic and isotropic electrostatic interactions on the aggregation behavior of these electric double-layered magnetic particles to be studied. Dynamic light scattering was used for monitoring the average diffusion coefficient of the magnetic filaments formed. Hydrodynamic equations were employed for obtaining the average chain lengths from the experimental mean diffusion coefficients. The results show that, for the same exposure time to the magnetic field, the average filament size is monotonously related to the amount of electrolyte added. The chain growth behavior was found to follow a power law with a similar exponent for all electrolyte concentrations used in this work. The time evolution of the average filament size can be rescaled such that all the curves collapse on a single master curve. Since the electrolyte added does not have any effect on the scaling behavior, the mechanism of aggregation seems to be completely controlled by the dipolar interaction. However, electrolyte addition not only controls the range of the total interaction between the particles, but also enhances the growth rate of the aggregation process. Taking into account the anisotropic character of these aggregation processes we propose a kernel that depends explicitly on the range of the dipolar interaction. The corresponding solutions of the Smoluchowski equation combined with theoretical models for the diffusion and light scattering by rigid rods reproduce the measured time evolution of the average perpendicular aggregate diffusion coefficient quite satisfactorily.},

The chain partition function is calculated analytically with the help of the rotation matrix technique under the condition when the interparticle dipole-dipole interaction between the nearest neighboring ferroparticles in each chain is taken into account. At weak fields, the chain distribution and the initial susceptibility are shown to be dependent on the value of the correlation coefficient describing the zero field mutual orientational correlations between the magnetic moments of two neighboring ferroparticles in a chain. The internal chain orientational correlations and the field dependent chain lengthening result in higher magnetization of the aggregated ferrofluid in comparison with the Langevin magnetization.},

	Abstract = {Using computer simulations, we study a membrane of parallel narrow pores filled with one-dimensional wires of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. We show that such a membrane is equivalent to a system of effective charges located at opposite sides of the membrane offering a computationally efficient way to model correlation effects in water-filled nanopore membranes. Based on our simulations we predict that membranes with square pore lattices undergo a continuous order-disorder transition to an antiferroelectric low-temperature phase in which water wires in adjacent pores are oriented in opposite directions. Strong antiferroelectric correlations exist also in the disordered phase far above the critical temperature or in membranes with geometric frustration, leading to a dielectric constant that is reduced considerably with respect to the case of uncoupled water wires. These correlations are also expected to hinder proton translocation through the membrane.},

	Abstract = {The adsorption of long flexible chains from dilute solution is studied by Monte Carlo simulation of a coarse-grained bead-spring model, and the results are interpreted in terms of phenomenological theories, using both mean field approaches and scaling concepts. It is shown that the surface excess, i.e., the integral of the local density difference of the monomers close to the surface relative to the bulk changes its sign very close to the adsorption transition (that is a sharp transition in the limit where the chain length diverges to infinity) for long chains, and it can be described in terms of the standard scaling description that has previously been tested for polymers with one end anchored on the surface ("polymer mushrooms"). Attention is also paid to the question on how this description changes when the temperature T of the polymer solution approaches the theta temperature Theta. Since the theta point can also be considered as an end point of a line of critical points, where the polymer solution phase separates into a dilute solution of collapsed chains and a more concentrated solution in the bulk, the adsorbing wall for T<Theta causes the existence of wetting layers. Conjectures about relations between wetting transitions for T near Theta and the adsorption transition are also presented.},

@article{2009-miller,
	Abstract = {We report the results of extensive molecular dynamics simulations of a simple, but experimentally achievable model of dipolar colloids. It is shown that a modest elongation of the particles and dipoles to make dipolar dumbbells favors branching of the dipolar strings that are routinely observed for point dipolar spheres (e.g., ferrofluids). This branching triggers the formation of a percolating transient network when the effective temperature is lowered along low packing fraction isochores (\phi<0.1). Well below the percolation temperature the evolution of various dynamical correlation functions becomes arrested over a rapidly increasing period of time, indicating that a gel has formed. The onset of arrest is closely linked to ongoing structural and topological changes, which we monitor using a variety of diagnostics, including the Euler characteristic. The present system, dominated by long-range interactions between particles, shows similarities to, but also some significant differences from the behavior of previously studied model systems involving short-range attractive interactions between colloids. In particular, we discuss the relation of gelformation to fluid--fluid phase separation and spinodal decomposition in the light of current knowledge of dipolar fluid phase diagrams.},

The two main applications of this fluid-cell platform are to provide a means to control and position magnetic microparticles, which can be tethered to biological molecules, and also to sort superparamagnetic microparticles based on their size and magnetic susceptibility. We determine the characteristic trapping forces of each trap in the array by measuring the Brownian motion of the microparticle as a function of applied external field. Typical force constants and forces on the superparamagnetic particles are 4.8×10−4$\pm$0.7×10−4 N/m and 97$\pm$15 pN, respectively.},

	Abstract = {In complex systems with many degrees of freedom such as peptides and proteins, there exists a huge number of local-minimum-energy states. Conventional simulations in the canonical ensemble are of little use, because they tend to get trapped in states of these energy local minima. A simulation in generalized ensemble performs a random walk in potential energy space and can overcome this difficulty. From only one simulation run, one can obtain canonical-ensemble averages of physical quantities as functions of temperature by the single-histogram and/or multiple-histogram reweighting techniques. In this article we review uses of the generalized-ensemble algorithms in biomolecular systems. Three well-known methods, namely, multicanonical algorithm, simulated tempering, and replica-exchange method, are described first. Both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics versions of the algorithms are given. We then present three new generalized-ensemble algorithms that combine the merits of the above methods. The effectiveness of the methods for molecular simulations in the protein folding problem is tested with short peptide systems.},

It is shown that the formalism allows to bring into agreement the results of Debye's, Onsager's, and Langevin's to the problem. The third virial coefficient of ϵ is considered as a series over dipolar parameter λ=m2/d3kT. The terms up to O(λ11) are calculated analytically providing a correct description of the third virial coefficient for small and intermediate values of λ (0⩽λ⩽4). The results of the dielectric virial series are compared with the Monte Carlo data for ϵ found by Matyushov and Ladanyi [J. Chem. Phys.110, 994 (1999)]. The theory is in agreement with simulations only at small values of λ⩽2. At higher polarities, the virial series diverges. Realization of the renormalization procedure permits to enlarge the range of applicability of the virial series. In this way, the new expression for the dielectric constant as a function of two dipolar parameters, λ and y=4πnm2/9kT, has been found explicitly. The expression gives a perfect upper bound of the dielectric constant and is more reliable for determination of ϵ than the previously known ones.},

	Abstract = {The enhancement of surface sensitivity by grazing incidence geometry facilitates the investigation of nanostructures in thin films and at surfaces. The technique provides information about the surface roughness, lateral correlations, sizes and shapes of objects (such as, nanoparticles and nanostructures) positioned on top of the surface or in a region near the surface. Grazing incidence small-angle neutron scattering (GISANS) overcomes the limitations of conventional small-angle neutron scattering for extremely small sample volumes in the thin-film geometry. Although real space analysis techniques, such as atomic force microscopy, provide easy access to surface structures, reciprocal space analysis techniques, such as GISANS, provide several advantages: (i) average statistical information over the large illuminated sample surface can be detected and (ii) buried lateral structures can be probed without damage, using the variable-probed depth as a function of the incident angle. To illustrate the potential applications and challenges of GISANS, several different examples of thin nanostructured polymer films are reviewed. Nanostructures in triblock copolymer thin films are studied in the bulk as well as at the polymer-air and the silicon--polymer interface. Confined nanostructures in a dewetted diblock copolymer film are also discussed in terms of contrast and experimental settings.},

Structural study shows that these phases are produced by the end-to-end adhesion and consequent stacking of the duplex oligomers into polydisperse anisotropic rod-shaped aggregates, which can order into liquid crystals. Upon cooling mixed solutions of short DNA oligomers, in which only a small fraction of the DNA present is complementary, the duplex-forming oligomers phase-separate into liquid crystal droplets, leaving the unpaired single strands in isotropic solution. In a chemical environment where oligomer ligation is possible, such ordering and condensation would provide an autocatalytic link whereby complementarity promotes the extended polymerization of complementary oligomers.},

	Abstract = {Steric stabilization is a generic term that embraces all aspects of the stabilization of colloidal particles by nonionic macromolecules. The technological exploitation of steric stabilization dates back at least 4000 years to the preparation in ancient Egypt of fresco paints and inks. Despite this long history, the mechanisms whereby polymers impart stability have only been recognized in the past two decades. Three types of experiment have proved useful in discriminating between the various competing theories of steric stabilization. These are studies of incipient flocculation, measurements of the repulsive interactions between stable particles, and stability in polymer melts. Experiments suggest that two separate regions of close approach must be distinguished: the interpenetration domain (characterized by an interparticle separation of between one and two contour lengths of the stabilizer chains) and the interpenetration plus compression domain, which is entered on even closer approach. Particle interactions in the interpenetrational region arise primarily from the mixing of segments and solvent; the elastic interactions are negligible. This mixing term is evaluated in the first generation theories via the Flory-Huggins theory. It may be positive or negative. As compression occurs on closer approach, the elastic contributions also become significant. These may be evaluated by statistical thermodynamics and are always positive. The foregoing concepts correctly predict the observed practical limit to stability, which is the attainment of theta-conditions for the stabilizing chains. Except for very short chains, the van der Waals attraction is rarely important in determining stabilization by polymers. Stabilization in polymer melts, however, arises primarily from elastic effects so that for these systems van der Waals forces become the major source of attraction. Elastic contributions increase abruptly, even under incipient flocculation conditions; consequently, Brownian collisions sample primarily the interpenetrational domain. The distance dependence of the repulsion between stable particles can be predicted with a fair degree of success.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In our earlier work (Steinbach et al., 2016 [1]) we investigated a homogeneous system of magnetically capped colloidal particles that self-assembled via two structural patterns of different symmetry. The particles could form a compact, equilateral triangle with a three-fold rotational symmetry and zero dipole moment and a staggered chain with mirror symmetry with a net magnetisation perpendicular to the chain. The system exhibited a bistability already in clusters of three particles. Based on observations of a real magnetic particles system, analytical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, it has been shown that the bistability is a result of an anisotropic magnetisation distribution with rotational symmetry inside the particles. The present study is a logical extension of the above research and forms a preparatory stage for the study of a self-assembly of such magnetic particles under the influence of an external magnetic field. Since the magnetic field is only an additive contribution to the total ground state energy, we can study the interparticle interaction energies of candidate ground state structures based on the field-free terms.},

	Abstract = {We present a theoretical study of Janus-like magnetic particles at low temperature. To describe the basic features of the Janus-type magnetic colloids, we put forward a simple model of a spherical particle with a dipole moment shifted outwards from the centre and oriented perpendicular to the particle radius. Using direct calculations and molecular dynamics computer simulations, we investigate the ground states of small clusters and the behaviour of bigger systems at low temperature. In both cases the important parameter is the dipolar shift, which leads to different ground states and, as a consequence, to a different microscopic behaviour in the situation when the thermal fluctuations are finite. We show that the head-to-tail orientation of dipoles provides a two-particle energy minima only if the dipoles are not shifted from the particle centres. This is one of the key differences from the system of shifted dipolar particles (sd-particles), in which the dipole was shifted outwards radially, studied earlier (Kantorovich et al 2011 Soft Matter 7 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1sm05186e] 5217--27 ). For sd-particles the dipole could be shifted out of the centre for almost 40\% before the head-to-tail orientation was losing its energetic advantage. This peculiarity manifests itself in the topology of the small clusters in the ground state and in the response of the Janus-like particle systems to an external magnetic field at finite temperatures.},

We consider a λ-driven coil-globule transition at constant temperature. The simulations are used to calculate average static structure factors, which are then used to determine the scaling exponents of the system in order to determine the θ-point values λθ separating the coil from the globule state. For each model we construct coil-globule phase diagrams in terms of λ and the particle density ρ. Additionally, we explore for each model the effects of varying the range of the attractive interactions on the phase boundary separating the coil and globule phases.

	Abstract = {We propose a simple statistical mechanical theory for a strongly dipolar fluid at low densities, based on the analogy between a polymer chain and a chain formed by strongly polar particles. The general methods developed in the theory of semiflexible polymers enable one to obtain simple expressions for the energy and conformational entropy of a long dipole chain. We then consider the equilibrium between chains of different lengths and derive a general expression for the free energy as a functional of the chain length distribution. Both steric and dipolar interactions between long chains are shown to be weak and as a result the rarefied fluid of strongly dipolar spheres resembles the ideal gas of noninteracting polydisperse chains. It is shown that the chain length distributions found in simulations are compatible with the assumption of very weak interchain interactions if strong finite-size effects are taken into account. We also investigate whether sufficiently strong attractive van der Waals forces between particles can cause dissociation of the chains. Finally, we discuss the case of a dipolar fluid in an applied field and argue that the coexistence between two aligned phases of chains, as observed by computer simulation, is unlikely to occur in an infinite system.},

The results show that the polymer brushes can be partially or fully stretched by applying an external electric field. Moreover, the brushes can switch reversibly from collapsed to stretched states, fully responding to the AC electric stimuli, and the gating response frequency can reach a few hundred MHz. The effects of the grafting density, the charge fraction of the brushes and the strength of the electric field on the average height of the polymer brushes were studied through the simulations.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the existence and location of the surface phase known as the 'surface-attached globule' (SAG) conjectured previously to exist in lattice models of three-dimensional polymers when they are attached to a wall that has a short-range potential. The bulk phase, where the attractive intra-polymer interactions are strong enough to cause a collapse of the polymer into a liquid-like globule and the wall either has weak attractive or repulsive interactions, is usually denoted desorbed-collapsed or DC. Recently, this DC phase was conjectured to harbour two surface phases separated by a boundary where the bulk free energy is analytic while the surface free energy is singular. The surface phase for more attractive values of the wall interaction is the SAG phase. We discuss in more detail the properties of this proposed surface phase and provide Monte Carlo evidence for self-avoiding walks up to a length 256 that this surface phase most likely does exist. Importantly, we discuss alternatives for the surface phase boundary. In particular, we conclude that this boundary may lie along the zero wall interaction line and the bulk phase boundaries rather than any new phase boundary curve.},

	Abstract = {In the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in studying nanoscale objects deposited on surfaces by grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). However, unravelling the structural properties of mesostructured thin films containing highly organized internal three-dimensional (3D) structures remains a challenging issue, because of the lack of efficient algorithms that allow prediction of the GISAXS intensity patterns. Previous attempts to calculate intensities have mostly been limited to cases of two-dimensional (2D) assemblies of nanoparticles at surfaces, or have been adapted to specific 3D cases. Here, we demonstrate that highly organized 3D mesoscale structures (for example, porous networks) can be modeled by the combined use of established crystallography formalism and the Distorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA). Taking advantage of the near-zero intensity of symmetry-allowed Bragg reflections, the casual extinction or existence of certain reflections related to the anisotropy of the form factor of the pores can be used as a highly sensitive method to extract structural information. We employ this generic method to probe the slightly compressed anisotropic shape and orientation of pores in a mesoporous silica thin film having P63/mmc symmetry.},

High statistics data are obtained for polymer volume fractions $\Phi$ in the range $0.025 \leqslant \Phi \leqslant 0.500$ and chain lengths N in the range $20 \leqslant N \leqslant 200$, making use of a parallel computer containing 80 transputers. The simulation technique takes into account both excluded volume interactions and entanglement restrictions, while otherwise the chains are non-interacting and athermal. The simulation data are analysed in terms of the de Gennes scaling concepts, describing the crossover from swollen coils in the dilute limit to gaussian coils in semidilute and concentrated solution. The crossover scaling functions for the chain linear dimensions and for the decay of the structure factor are estimated and compared to corresponding theoretical and experimental results in the literature. Also the dynamics of the chains is studied in detail, and evidence for a gradual crossover from the Rouse model to a $D \sim N^$ law for the diffusion constant is presented. This crossover is consistent with scaling only if a concentration-dependent segmental "friction coefficient" is introduced. Within this framework general agreement between these data, other simulations and experiment is found.},

A crucial issue in the study of these outstanding materials is the interaction between the mesoscopic magnetic particles and the polymer matrix in which they are embedded. Here we analyze interactions between two such particles connected by a polymer chain, a situation representative for particle-crosslinked magnetic gels. To make a first step towards a scale-bridging description of the materials, effective pair potentials for mesoscopic configurational changes are specified using microscopic input obtained from simulations. Furthermore, the impact of the presence of magnetic interactions on the probability distributions and thermodynamic quantities of the system is considered. The resulting mesoscopic model pair potentials can be used to economically model the system on the particle length scales. This first coarse-graining step is important to realize simplified but realistic scale-bridging models for these promising materials.},

Our study shows that NR superstructure formation occurs at the liquid/air interface. Short NRs self-assemble into micrometers long tracks of NRs lying side by side flat on the surface. In contrast, longer NRs align vertically into ordered superstructures. Systematic variation of the NR length and initial concentration of the NR dispersion allowed us to tune the orientation of the NRs in the final superstructure. With GISAXS, we were able to follow the dynamics of the self-assembly. We propose a model of hierarchical self-organization that provides a basis for the understanding of the length-dependent self-organization of NRs at the liquid/air interface.

A tension-dependent, nonzero optimal stiffness κmin exists, for which DFknotting is minimal. For a polymer chain with several stiffness domains, each containing a large amount of monomers, the domain with stiffness κmin will be preferred by the knot. A local analysis of the bending in the interior of the knot reveals that local stretching of chains at the braid region is responsible for the fact that the tension-dependent optimal stiffness has a nonzero value. The reduction in DFknotting for a chain with optimal stiffness relative to the flexible chain can be enhanced by tuning the slit width of the 2D confinement and increasing the knot complexity. The optimal stiffness itself is independent of the knot types we considered, while confinement shifts it toward lower values.},

	Abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the coil-globule transition for a system composed of a bead-spring polymer immersed in an explicitly modeled solvent. Two different versions of the model are used, which are differentiated by the nature of monomer-solvent, solvent-solvent, and nonbonded monomer-monomer interactions. For each case, a model parameter λ determines the degree of hydrophobicity of the monomers by controlling the degree of energy mismatch between the monomers and solvent particles. We consider a λ-driven coil-globule transition at constant temperature. The simulations are used to calculate average static structure factors, which are then used to determine the scaling exponents of the system in order to determine the θ-point values λθ separating the coil from the globule states. For each model we construct coil-globule phase diagrams in terms of λ and the particle density ρ. The results are analyzed in terms of a simple Flory-type theory of the collapse transition. The ratio of λθ for the two models converges in the high density limit exactly to the value predicted by the theory in the random mixing approximation. Generally, the predicted values of λθ are in reasonable agreement with the measured values at high ρ, though the accuracy improves if the average chain size is calculated using the full probability distribution associated with the polymer-solvent free energy, rather than merely using the value obtained from the minimum of the free energy},

	Abstract = {The coil-globule transition of a polymer in a solvent has been studied using Monte Carlo simulations of a single chain subject to intramolecular interactions as well as a solvent-mediated effective potential. This solvation potential was calculated using several different theoretical approaches for two simple polymer/solvent models, each employing hard-sphere chains and hard-sphere solvent particles as well as attractive square-well potentials between some interaction sites. For each model, collapse is driven by variation in a parameter which changes the energy mismatch between monomers and solvent particles. The solvation potentials were calculated using two fundamentally different methodologies, each designed to predict the conformational behavior of polymers in solution: (1) the polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) theory and (2) a many-body solvation potential (MBSP) based on scaled particle theory introduced by Grayce [J. Chem. Phys. 106, 5171 (1997)] . For the PRISM calculations, two well-studied solvation monomer-monomer pair potentials were employed, each distinguished by the closure relation used in its derivation: (i) a hypernetted-chain (HNC)-type potential and (ii) a Percus--Yevick (PY)-type potential. The theoretical predictions were each compared to results obtained from explicit-solvent discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations on the same polymer/solvent model systems [ J. Chem. Phys. 125, 194904 (2006) ]. In each case, the variation in the coil-globule transition properties with solvent density is mostly qualitatively correct, though the quantitative agreement between the theory and prediction is typically poor. The HNC-type potential yields results that are more qualitatively consistent with simulation. The conformational behavior of the polymer upon collapse predicted by the MBSP approach is quantitatively correct for low and moderate solvent densities but is increasingly less accurate for higher densities. At high solvent densities, the PRISM-HNC and MBSP approaches tend to overestimate, while the PRISM-PY approach underestimates the tendency of the solvent to drive polymer collapse.},

	Abstract = {Experimental studies made on different ferrofluid samples under shear flow have shown that an increase of magnetic field strength yields an increase of the fluid's viscosity, the so-called magnetoviscous effect, while increasing shear rate leads to a decrease of the viscosity. The change of the viscosity with magnetic field strength can be theoretically explained as an effect of chain-like structure formation and therefore can be related to the modification of the microstructure of ferrofluids. Using a specially designed rheometer, ferrofluids having different magnitude of the magnetoviscous effect were investigated by small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Correlated to the structure formation in the fluid, the scattered intensity shows a variation with magnetic field and shear rate only for fluids with a high magnetoviscous effect. The results obtained show a good agreement with the qualitative model elaborated to explain the magnetoviscous effect, indicating a strong connection between the rheological behaviour of ferrofluids and their microstructure.},

	Abstract = {Inspired by experimental studies of short-ranged attractive patchy particles{,} we study with computer simulations the phase behavior and the crystalline structures of one-patch colloids with an interaction range equal to 5% of the particle diameter. In particular{,} we study the effects of the patch surface coverage fraction{,} defined as the ratio between the attractive and the total surface of a particle. Using free-energy calculations and thermodynamic integration schemes{,} we evaluate the equilibrium phase diagrams for particles with patch coverage fractions of 30%{,} 50% and 60%. For a 60% surface coverage fraction{,} we observe stable lamellar crystals consisting of stacked bilayers that directly coexist with a low density fluid. Inside the coexistence region{,} we observe the formation of lamellar structures also in direct NVT simulations{,} indicating that the barrier of formation is low and experimental realization is feasible. For sufficiently strong interactions{,} these structures spontaneously assemble from the fluid in simulations{,} suggesting that they might also easily form in experimental systems. In the Janus case{,} i.e. at 50% surface coverage fraction{,} no lamellar structures are formed{,} and the stable crystals are similar to those that have been found previously for a longer interaction range (i.e. 20% of the particle diameter). At 30% coverage fraction{,} we identify novel {'}open{'} crystal structures with large unit cells of up to 14 particles that are stable in the strong interaction limit.},

	Abstract = {A combination of analytical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations is used to find the ground state structures in monodisperse ferrofluid monolayers. Taking into account the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between all particles in the system we observe different topological structures that are likely to exist at low temperatures. The most energetically favored structures we find are rings, embedded rings, and rings side by side, and we are able to derive analytical expressions for the total energy of these structures. A detailed analysis of embedded rings and rings side by side shows that the interring interactions are negligible. We furthermore find that a single ideal ring is the ground state structure for a ferrofluid monolayer. We compared our theoretical predictions to the results of simulated annealing data and found them to be in excellent agreement.},

The review assesses the current efforts on in vitro synthesis of a variety of magnetic nanoparticles using bioinspired approaches by utilizing mineralization proteins from magnetotactic bacteria, and surveys biomimetic strategies for the rational synthesis of various magnetic nanomaterials under ambient conditions. Finally, this review presents magnetic characterization of nanoparticles, highlighting differences in magnetic behavior between magnetic nanoparticles produced using bioinspired in vivo and in vitro strategies, compared to those produced using conventional methods. This in turn impacts their utility in a wide range of applications for magnetic nanoparticles, which are examined in detail, where bioinspired synthesis methods have potentially provided added advantages.},

For a nematically ordered system, one can distinguish between the spatial correlations in the plane perpendicular to the crystalline axis, and in the direction parallel to the latter. Following this separation, we show that the RDFs in the parallel case can be described using a superposition of a chain model and Onsager distribution, whereas the RDFs in the perpendicular case turn out to be that of the soft disks. Based on this concept, we show how the spatial correlations in the system are influenced by the nematic order parameter.

	Abstract = {Practical applications of polymer brush-like systems rely on a clear understanding of their internal structure. In the case of magnetic nanoparticle filament brushes, the competition between bonding and non bonding interactions---including the long range magnetic dipole-dipole interaction---makes the microstructure of these polymer brush-like systems rather complex. On the other hand, the same interactions open up the possibility to manipulate the meso- and macroscopic responses of these systems by applying external magnetic fields or by changing the background temperature. In this study, we put forward an approach to extract information about the internal structure of a magnetic filament brush from scattering experiments. Our method is based on the mapping of the scattering profiles to the information about the internal equilibrium configurations of the brushes obtained from computer simulations. We show that the structure of the magnetic filament brush is strongly anisotropic in the direction perpendicular to the grafting surface, especially at low temperatures and external fields. This makes slice-by-slice scattering measurements a technique very useful for the study of such systems.},

	Abstract = {Using a combination of analytical theory, Monte Carlo simulations, and three-dimensional self-consistent field calculations, we study the equilibrium properties and the switching behavior of adsorption-active polymer chains included in a homopolymer brush. The switching transition is driven by a conformational change of a small fraction of minority chains, which are attracted by the substrate. Depending on the strength of the attractive interaction, the minority chains assume one of two states: an exposed state characterized by a stem-crown-like conformation and an adsorbed state characterized by a flat two-dimensional structure. Comparing the Monte Carlo simulations, which use an Edwards-type Hamiltonian with density-dependent interactions, with the predictions from self-consistent-field theory based on the same Hamiltonian, we find that thermal density fluctuations affect the system in two different ways. First, they renormalize the excluded volume interaction parameter vbare inside the brush. The properties of the brushes can be reproduced by self-consistent field theory if one replaces vbare by an effective parameter veff, where the ratio of second virial coefficients Beff/Bbare depends on the range of monomer interactions but not on the grafting density, the chain length, and vbare. Second, density fluctuations affect the conformations of chains at the brush surface and have a favorable effect on the characteristics of the switching transition: In the interesting regime where the transition is sharp, they reduce the free energy barrier between the two states significantly. The scaling behavior of various quantities is also analyzed and compared with analytical predictions.},

A detailed deposition rate diagram is obtained to identify the relationship between deposition rate and assembly behavior. The extent of iron oxidation is identified as the key parameter in determining the assembly behavior. In addition, the effects of particle volume fraction, thickness of the iron oxide cap, and assembly time on the final assembly behavior are studied. Cap thickness is shown not to influence the assembly behavior, while particle volume fraction and assembly time affect the chain growth rate and the chain length, but not the overall assembly behavior.

	Abstract = {When a polymer chain in solution interacts with an atomically smooth solid substrate, its conformational properties are strongly modified and deviate substantially from those of chains in bulk. In this work, the interplay of two competing transitions that affect the conformations of polymer chains near an energetically attractive surface is studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations on a cubic lattice. The transition from an extended to a compact conformation of a polymer chain near an attractive wall, as solubility deteriorates, exhibits characteristics akin to the ldquocoil-to-globulerdquo transition in bulk. An effective &thetas;-temperature is determined. Its role as the transition point is confirmed in a variety of ways. The nature of the coil-to-compact transition is not qualitatively different from that in the bulk. Adsorbed polymer chains may assume ldquoglobularrdquo or ldquopancakerdquo configurations depending on the competition among adsorption strength, cohesive energy, and entropy. In a very relevant range of conditions, the dependence of the adsorbate thickness on chain-length is intermediate between that of 3-d (ldquosemidropletsrdquo) and 2-d (ldquopancakerdquo) objects. The focus of this study is on rather long polymer chains. Several crucial features of the transitions of the adsorbed chains are N-dependent and various aspects of the adsorption and ldquodissolutionrdquo process are manifested clearly only at the ldquolong chainrdquo limit.},

	Abstract = { We explore the effects of thermostats in replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. For thermostats that do not produce a canonical ensemble, REMD simulations are found to distort the configuration-space distributions. For bulk water, we find small deviations of the average potential energies, the buildup of tails in the potential energy distributions, and artificial correlations between the energies at different temperatures. If a solute is present, as in protein folding simulations, its conformational equilibrium can be altered. In REMD simulations of a helix-forming peptide with a weak-coupling (Berendsen) thermostat, we find that the folded state is overpopulated by about 10% at low temperatures, and underpopulated at high temperatures. As a consequence, the enthalpy of folding deviates by almost 3 kcal/mol from the correct value. The reason for this population shift is that noncanonical ensembles with narrowed potential energy fluctuations artificially bias toward replica exchanges between low-energy folded structures at the high temperature and high-energy unfolded structures at the low temperature. We conclude that REMD simulations should only be performed in conjunction with thermostats that produce a canonical ensemble. },

@article{2006-rothemund,
	Abstract = {'Bottom-up fabrication', which exploits the intrinsic properties of atoms and molecules to direct their self-organization, is widely used to make relatively simple nanostructures. A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by 'top-down' methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide 'staple strands' to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex).},

	Abstract = {In this contribution, we investigate the low-temperature, low-density behaviour of dipolar hard-sphere (DHS) particles, i.e., hard spheres with dipoles embedded in their centre. We aim at describing the DHS fluid in terms of a network of chains and rings (the fundamental clusters) held together by branching points (defects) of different nature. We first introduce a systematic way of classifying inter-cluster connections according to their topology, and then employ this classification to analyse the geometric and thermodynamic properties of each class of defects, as extracted from state-of-the-art equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations. By computing the average density and energetic cost of each defect class, we find that the relevant contribution to inter-cluster interactions is indeed provided by (rare) three-way junctions and by four-way junctions arising from parallel or anti-parallel locally linear aggregates. All other (numerous) defects are either intra-cluster or associated to low cluster-cluster interaction energies, suggesting that these defects do not play a significant part in the thermodynamic description of the self-assembly processes of dipolar hard spheres.},

	Abstract = {The equilibrium structure of supramolecular magnetic filament brushes is analyzed at two different scales. First, we study the density and height distributions for brushes with various grafting densities and chain lengths. We use Langevin dynamics simulations with a bead--spring model that takes into account the cross-links between the surface of the ferromagnetic particles, whose magnetization is characterized by a point dipole. Magnetic filament brushes are shown to be more compact near the substrate than nonmagnetic ones, with a bimodal height distribution for large grafting densities. This latter feature makes them also different from brushes with electric dipoles. Next, in order to explain the observed behavior at the filament scale, we introduce a graph theory analysis to elucidate for the first time the structure of the brush at the scale of individual beads. It turns out that, in contrast to nonmagnetic brushes, in which the internal structure is determined by random density fluctuations, magnetic forces introduce a certain order in the system. Because of their highly directional nature, magnetic dipolar interactions prevent some of the random connections to be formed. On the other hand, they favor a higher connectivity of the chains' free and grafted ends. We show that this complex dipolar brush microstructure has a strong impact on the magnetic response of the brush, as any weak applied field has to compete with the dipole--dipole interactions within the crowded environment.},

In order to determine and optimise the properties of the magnetic filament brush, we perform extensive computer simulations with a coarse-grained model that takes into account the correlations between the magnetic moments of the particles and the backbone crosslinks. We show that the self-assembly of magnetic beads from neighbouring filaments defines the equilibrium structural properties of the complete brush. In order to control this self-assembly, we highlight two external stimuli that can lead to significant effects: temperature of the system and an externally applied magnetic field. Our study reveals self-assembly scenarios inherently driven by the crosslinking and grafting constraints.

	Abstract = {The adsorption of stiff magnetic filaments close to an attractive surface is studied thoroughly via extensive Langevin dynamics simulations (LD). Magnetic filaments are represented by a coarse-grained bead-spring model where each bead bears a point dipole located at its center and the excluded volume interaction is introduced via a soft-core repulsive potential. We find strong evidence for the existence of two transitions as the temperature is lowered. First, the system undergoes a continuum phase transition from the desorbed to the adsorbed state. This transition is followed by a second structural transition that takes place when the filaments are already adsorbed. The adsorption transition is found to be very similar to the one observed for stiff non-magnetic polymer chains [Sintes et al., Macromolecules 2001, 34, 1352--1357] where the chain bending interaction plays a similar role as the magnetic component of the present case. However, the tendency of the magnetic chains to stretch is reversed by a further reduction in temperature and the chains tend to form closed adsorbed loops leading to a second structural transition. A representation of the phase diagram for the adsorption of magnetic filaments is determined here for the first time. We also present a novel way to determine the temperature at which the chain is adsorbed that is based on the analysis of the change in the number of trains, tails and loops developed by the polymer chain during the adsorption process.},

Using tetramethylammonium hydroxide as base instead of the volatile ammonia facilitates continuous seeded growth of silica to colloids with a desired aspect ratio. A convenient feature of the hematite−silica particles is the rapid dissolution of the iron oxide core by acid, producing hollow silica ellipsoids that can be optically matched to near transparency. The control of shape and size of the silica ellipsoids, their optical properties, and the fairly high yield in comparison to other preparation methods for nonspherical model colloids make the ellipsoids very suitable for quantitative studies. As a case in point, we have measured the rotational diffusion coefficient of fluorescent ellipsoids with rotational fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Dye-labeled ellipsoids can be imaged with confocal microscopy.},

This assembly is driven by tunable magnetostatic binding forces that originate from microscopic permanent magnets embedded underneath the surface of the particles. The resulting clusters form spontaneously in the absence of external magnetizing fields, and their geometry is determined by an interplay between magnetic, steric, and electrostatic interactions. Imposing an external magnetic field enables the clusters to unbind or change their geometry allowing, in principle, the creation of materials with a reconfigurable structural arrangement.},

Being a chainlike molecule, DNA directs the growth of the particles in its own direction. Particle size is varied from 7 to 17 nm simply by varying the duration of the addition of coprecipitating agent. FTIR study confirms the bonding between metal ions and the phosphate backbone of the DNA chain. DC magnetic measurements reveal the decrease in anisotropy energy with increasing particle diameter. Smaller values of saturation magnetization of the nanoparticles than those of the bulk value are due to the presence of the magnetic dead layer in the nanoparticles (magnetic core and nonmagnetic shell), but in our case, the shell thickness decreases with an increase in particle size, which is opposite in trend as reported by other authors. Dynamic ac susceptibility measurements for the smallest particles (d ≈ 7 nm) show Neel--Arrhenius dependence of the blocking temperature with varying excitation frequency.},

These intermediates form a well-defined, hierarchical family of conformations. Experiments with DNA condensation have shown similar shapes, which were described as "tennis racquets''. In addition to our primary observation concerning the collapse pathways of stiff filaments, we note that, in the absence of fluctuations (upon annealing), the shape of these intermediates can be calculated exactly in certain limits, and is given by a particular case of Euler's elastica. This shape is unique up to an overall scale factor determined by the parameters for bending stiffness and short-range attraction.},

The contribution to the static permittivity of the sodium chloride solution coming from the ion-ion correlations, often neglected in simulation studies but implicitly taken into account in experimental measurements, are shown to be important, although particularly hard to measure.

	Abstract = { The chemistry and topography of a surface affect biological response and are of fundamental importance, especially when living systems encounter synthetic surfaces. Most biomolecules have immense recognition power (specific binding) and simultaneously have a tendency to physically adsorb onto a solid substrate without specific receptor recognition (nonspecific adsorption). Therefore, to create useful materials for many biotechnology applications, interfaces are required that have both enhanced specific binding and reduced nonspecific binding. Thus, in applications such as sensors, the tailoring of surface chemistry and the use of micro or nanofabrication techniques becomes an important avenue for the production of surfaces with specific binding properties and minimal background interference. Both self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and polymer brushes have attracted considerable attention as surface-active materials. In this review, we discuss both of these materials with their potential applications in biotechnology.

	Abstract = {Magnetic beads and superparamagnetic (SP) colloid particles have successfully been employed for micromechanical manipulation of soft material, in situ probing of elastic properties, and design of smart materials (ferrogels). Here we derive analytical expressions for the equilibrium shape of magnetic fibers, considering two end-member cases, (a) SP or single-domain particles concentrated at the free end of cantilevered rods or tubes, and (b) filaments consisting of SP particles, with this case being mathematically equivalent to tubes containing SP particles. Our analysis yields also metastable equilibrium states (MES's), which only exist above a critical filament length, but become more stable with increasing magnetic field. The MES's for case (a) are, like the ground state, circular arcs, but more strongly bent. The multiform MES's in case (b), which comprise hairpin, sinuous, or even closed shapes, have recently been observed in experiments, too. We also study the effect of gravity on the balance between bending and magnetic energy, which leads to curves with inflection point if the influence of gravity is stronger than that of the magnetic field. Because of their simple experimental realization, case (a) magnetic filaments are deemed highly suitable for micromechanical experiments on long chains of polymer molecules. Another potential application of cantilevered magnetic filaments with magnetic material attached to the free end is in scanning probe microscopes. Because the magnetic field due to the magnetic tip is comparatively weak, the magnetization structure of the sample to be investigated would not be affected by the probe. Thus, for the examination of magnetically soft materials, probes in the form of magnetic filaments may hold advantages over tips usually employed in magnetic force microscopy.},

The relationship between interparticle distance (horizontal and vertical direction) of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and magnetic properties (Hc, Ms and anisotropy) of the (APTS-Fe3O4/LDH)n films is discussed from the viewpoint of charge density and layer thickness of LDH nanosheets, respectively. The maximum Ms is present in the sample of x=3 and t=0 (x and t stand for ratio of Mg and Al on the LDH layer, and exfoliating time of LDH nanosheets, respectively), which is 32.5 and 25.4 emu g--1 in perpendicular and parallel direction, respectively.

	Abstract = {We have developed an efficient, one-step method to create magnetic nanowires consisting of permanently linked chains of magnetic beads of varying flexibility tethered to a patterned glass surface using simple amidation chemistry. The flexibility of the nanowire was governed by the molecular weight of the molecule used to covalently link the beads and its length by the height of the microchannel in which it was synthesized. The nanowire diameter was determined both by the bead size and by the number of beads adhering to each dot in the microstamped, patterned array. Longer nanowires can form loops attached at two points on the glass surface. Both single flexible chains and flexible loops can adopt different configurations (straight, hairpin, S-shaped, etc.) when subjected to magnetic fields, the configurations depending on the directions of these fields. Shorter, less flexible nanowires align with the field always and do not exhibit the more exotic configurations seen for long, flexible chains and loops. These magnetic nanowires can have potential use in microfluidic pumping and mixing processes and in microparticle manipulation.},

Adsorption characteristics were studied at different temperatures for chains of various stiffnesses. We have found that the stiffer chains adsorb more onto the surface and the adsorption transition takes place at a higher temperature when compared to that of the flexible chains. As stiffness increases, the adsorption transition is found to be sharper. The computed persistence length is found to grow linearly for small values of the bending energy, while for higher values, it shows a square root dependence. In the ground state, the parallel size of the stiffer chain is found to be much larger than that of the corresponding flexible polymer chain. The classical scaling laws for the flexible chains were tested for the stiffer chains and found that they are well obeyed, indicating that the universal properties of the chain measured over its whole dimension are unaffected by the local stiffness of the chain.},

	Abstract = {One of the most controversial hypotheses for explaining the origin of the thermodynamic anomalies characterizing liquid water postulates the presence of a metastable second-order liquid--liquid critical point1 located in the `no-man's land'2. In this scenario, two liquids with distinct local structure emerge near the critical temperature. Unfortunately, as spontaneous crystallization is rapid in this region, experimental support for this hypothesis relies on significant extrapolations, either from the metastable liquid or from amorphous solid water3, 4. Although the liquid-liquid transition is expected to feature in many tetrahedrally coordinated liquids, including silicon5, carbon6 and silica, even numerical studies of atomic and molecular models have been unable to conclusively prove the existence of this transition. Here we provide such evidence for a model in which it is possible to continuously tune the softness of the interparticle interaction and the flexibility of the bonds, the key ingredients controlling the existence of the critical point. We show that conditions exist where the full coexistence is thermodynamically stable with respect to crystallization. Our work offers a basis for designing colloidal analogues of water exhibiting liquid--liquid transitions in equilibrium, opening the way for experimental confirmation of the original hypothesis.},

In addition, the calculated free energy landscape is not restricted to the actual choice of collective variables and can in principle be extended to auxiliary variables of interest without further numerical effort. The applicability is shown for several examples. We present numerical results for the alanine dipeptide and the Met-Enkephalin in explicit solution to illustrate our approach.

Prior work on modeling the behavior of ferrofluids has focused on using phenomenological suspension-scale continuum equations. A disadvantage of this approach is the controversy surrounding the equation describing the rate of change of the ferrofluid magnetization, the so-called magnetization relaxation equation. In this contribution the viscosity of dilute suspensions of spherical magnetic nanoparticles suspended in a Newtonian fluid and under applied shear and constant magnetic fields is studied through rotational Brownian dynamics simulations. Simulation results are compared with the predictions of suspension-scale models based on three magnetization relaxation equations. Excellent agreement is observed between simulation results and the predictions of an equation due to Martsenyuk, Raikher, and Shliomis. Good qualitative agreement is observed with predictions of other equations, although these models fail to accurately predict the magnitude and shear rate dependence of the magnetic-field-dependent effective viscosity. Finally, simulation results over a wide range of conditions are collapsed into master curves using a Mason number defined based on the balance of hydrodynamic and magnetic torques.},

A satisfactory understanding of the microscopic origin of anisotropy of the magnetoviscous effect in magnetic fluids is still a matter of debate and a field of intense research. Here, we present an extensive simulation study to understand the relation between the anisotropy of the magnetoviscous effect and the underlying change in microstructures of ferrofluids. Our results indicate that field-induced chainlike structures respond very differently depending on their orientation relative to the direction of an externally applied shear flow, which leads to a pronounced anisotropy of viscosity. In this work, we focus on three exemplary values of dipolar interaction strengths which correspond to weak, intermediate, and strong interactions between dipolar colloidal particles. We compare our simulation results with an experimental study on cobalt-based ferrofluids as well as with an existing theoretical model called the chain model. A nonmonotonic behavior in the anisotropy of the magnetoviscous effect is observed with increasing dipolar interaction strength and is explained in terms of microstructure formation.},

	Abstract = {DNA-driven assembly of nanoscale objects has emerged as a powerful platform for the creation of materials by design via self-assembly. Recent years have seen much progress in the experimental realization of this approach for three-dimensional systems. In contrast, two-dimensional (2D) programmable nanoparticle (NP) systems are not well explored, in part due to the difficulties in creating such systems. Here we demonstrate the use of charged liquid interfaces for the assembly and reorganization of 2D systems of DNA-coated NPs. The absorption of DNA-coated NPs to the surface is controlled by the interaction between a positively charged lipid layer and the negatively charged DNA shells of particles. At the same time, interparticle interactions are switchable, from electrostatic repulsion between DNA shells to attraction driven by DNA complementarity, by increasing ionic strength. Using in situ surface X-ray scattering methods and ex situ electron microscopy, we reveal the corresponding structural transformation of the NP monolayer, from a hexagonally ordered 2D lattice to string-like clusters and finally to a weakly ordered network of DNA cross-linked particles. Moreover, we demonstrate that the ability to regulate 2D morphology yields control of the interfacial rheological properties of the NP membrane: from viscous to elastic. Theoretical modeling suggests that the structural adaptivity of interparticle DNA linkages plays a crucial role in the observed 2D transformation of DNA-NP systems at liquid interfaces.},

	Abstract = { Ordered two-dimensional (2D) superstructures of colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) can be tailored by the size, shape, composition, and surface chemistry of the NC building blocks, which can give directionality to the resulting superstructure geometry. The exact formation mechanism of 2D NC superstructures is however not yet fully understood. Here, we show that oleic acid (OA) ligands induce atomic alignment of wurtzite ZnS bifrustum-shaped NCs. We find that in the presence of OA ligands the {002} facets of the ZnS bifrustums preferentially adhere to the liquid--air interface. Furthermore, OA ligands induce inter-NC interactions that also orient the NCs in the plane of the liquid--air interface, resulting in atomically aligned 2D superstructures. We follow the self-assembly process in real-time with in situ grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and find that the NCs form a hexagonal superstructure at early stages after which they come closer over time, resulting in a close-packed NC superstructure. Our results demonstrate the profound influence that surface ligands have on the directionality of 2D NC superstructures and highlight the importance of detailed in situ studies in order to understand the self-assembly of NCs into 2D superstructures. },

	Abstract = {This paper deals with the investigation of cohesive energy in dipolar helices made up of hard spheres. Such tubular helical structures are ubiquitous objects in biological systems. We observe a complex dependence of cohesive energy on surface packing fraction and dipole moment distribution. As far as single helices are concerned{,} the lowest cohesive energy is achieved at the highest surface packing fraction. Besides{,} a striking non-monotonic behavior is reported for the cohesive energy as a function of the surface packing fraction. For multiple helices{,} we discover a new phase{,} exhibiting markedly higher cohesive energy. This phase is referred to as ZZ tube consisting of stacked crown rings (reminiscent of a pile of zig-zag rings){,} resulting in a local triangular arrangement with densely packed filaments parallel to the tube axis.},

Besides being a fundamental test system for theory, dipolar fluids are used as models for ferrofluids. Gibbs ensemble simulations were performed to determine the coexistence curve and an estimate of the critical temperature, Tc, and density, ρc, as a function of applied magnetic field. In zero field we show that coexistence most likely does not occur and if it does can only do so in a narrow range of densities much lower than predicted theoretically.

Besides being fundamental test systems for theory, dipolar fluids are models for ferrofluids. We show that chain formation is a fundamental characteristic of the SSD fluid resulting in a phase diagram much different from fluids with an isotropic potential. In particular, two-phase liquid-gas coexistence does not appear to occur in the absence of an applied field. In an applied field, phase coexistence does occur and we discuss the structure of the SSD system in the vicinity of the critical point. In contrast to expectations, the SSD does not model ferrofluids well. An additional attractive interaction beyond the dipolar interaction is needed to model ferrofluids.},

	Abstract = {The results of Monte Carlo simulations carried out on a system of multiblock copolymers having two different types of monomer units adsorbed on checker board surface configurations are presented here. We investigated the adsorption behavior for a series of different chess board square dimensions and also for various block lengths of the copolymer. We find that the specific heat capacity curves for adsorption indicate double peaks showing a two stage pattern recognition of the copolymer on the surface. It is also seen that the transition that happens at lower temperature corresponds to pinning where the junction point of the different blocks gets pinned to the interface between the different surface sites. It is interesting to see that the multiblock copolymers form multiple pinning sites on the boundary between different kinds of surface sites. There exists an intermediate size of the square on the board where the recognition and pinning are most favored and for smaller and larger size of the board and block length, the adsorption proceeds like in homopolymer on homogeneous surfaces. Unlike in the case of the simplest model of diblock copolymer on stripe-patterned surfaces [K. Sumithra and E. Straube, J. Chem. Phys. 125, 154701 (2006)], here the recognition is stronger and the average adsorption energy and the perpendicular component of the radius of gyration show distinct changes corresponding to the two transitions. The conformational properties of the multiblock copolymer near the checkered surface show interesting effects with the perpendicular component showing strong deviations from the standard behavior.},

	Abstract = { Well-defined nanoscale flux-closure polygons (nanogons) have been fabricated on hydrophilic surfaces from the face-to-face self-assembly of magnetite nanocubes. Uniform ferrimagnetic magnetite nanocubes (∼86 nm) were synthesized and characterized with a combination of electron microscopy, diffraction, and magnetization measurements. The nanocubes were subsequently cast onto hydrophilic substrates, wherein the cubes lined up face-to-face and formed a variety of polygons due to magnetostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The generated surfaces consist primarily of three- and four-sided nanogons; polygons ranging from two to six sides were also observed. Further examination of the nanogons showed that the constraints of the face-to-face assembly of nanocubes often led to bowed sides, strained cube geometries, and mismatches at the acute angle vertices. Additionally, extra nanocubes were often present at the vertices, suggesting the presence of external magnetostatic fields at the polygon corners. These nanogons are inimitable nanoscale magnetic structures with potential applications in the areas of magnetic memory storage and high-frequency magnetics. },

	Abstract = {Nanoparticle (NP) assemblies are of considerable interest for both fundamental research and applications, since they provide direct bridges between nanometer-scale objects and the macroscale world. Unlike two-dimensional or three-dimensional NP assemblies, which have been extensively studied and reviewed, reports on one-dimensional (1D) NP assemblies are rather rare, even though these assemblies are likely to play critical roles in the improvement of the efficiencies of various electronic, optoelectronic, magnetic, and other devices based on single NPs or their composites. Additionally, 1D assemblies of NPs, i.e., chains, can significantly help in the understanding of a number of biological processes and fundamental quantum mechanics of nanometer-scale systems. The difficulties are very evident when one wants to realize anisotropic 1D assemblies from presumably isotropic, zero-dimensional NPs. In this context, the authors present a systemic review of current research on 1D NP assemblies. Their preparation methods are classified and novel characteristics of NP chains, such as collective properties and directional transfer of photons, electrons, spins, etc., are elucidated. Current problems underlying the fundamental research and practical applications of 1D NP assemblies are also addressed.},

Here we study such solvent effects in a system consisting of a flexible interaction-site n-mer chain immersed in a monomeric solvent. Chain conformation is described with a set of intramolecular site-site probability functions. We derive an exact density expansion for these intramolecular probability functions and give a diagrammatic representation of the terms contributing at each order of the expansion. The expansion is tested for a short hard-sphere chain (n = 3 or 4) with site diameter σ in a hard-sphere solvent with solvent diameter D. In comparison with Monte Carlo simulation results for 0.2 ⩽ D/σ ⩽ 100, the expansion (taken to second order) is found to be quantitatively accurate for low to moderate solvent volume fractions for all size ratios. Average chain dimensions are predicted accurately up to liquidlike solvent densities. The hard-sphere chains are compressed with both increasing solvent density and decreasing solvent size. For small solvent (D<σ), depletion effects are found and the chain structure is strongly perturbed even at low solvent volume fractions.},

	Abstract = {A single flexible homopolymer chain can assume a variety of conformations which can be broadly classified as expanded coil, collapsed globule, and compact crystallite. Here we study transitions between these conformational states for an interaction-site polymer chain comprised of N = 128 square-well-sphere monomers with hard-sphere diameter σ and square-well diameter λσ. Wang--Landau sampling with bond-rebridging Monte Carlo moves is used to compute the density of states for this chain and both canonical and microcanonical analyses are used to identify and characterize phase transitions in this finite size system. The temperature-interaction range (i.e., T-λ) phase diagram is constructed for λ ≤ 1.30. Chains assume an expanded coil conformation at high temperatures and a crystallite structure at low temperatures. For λ>1.06 these two states are separated by an intervening collapsed globule phase and thus, with decreasing temperature a chain undergoes a continuous coil-globule (collapse) transition followed by a discontinuous globule-crystal (freezing) transition. For well diameters λ<1.06 the collapse transition is pre-empted by the freezing transition and thus there is a direct first-order coil-crystal phase transition. These results confirm the recent prediction, based on a lattice polymer model, that a collapsed globule state is unstable with respect to a solid phase for flexible polymers with sufficiently short-range monomer-monomer interactions.},

Both top-down and bottom-up fabrication approaches may be used to realize a range of well-defined nanostructured materials with desirable physical and chemical attributes. Among these, the bottom-up self-assembly process offers the most realistic solution toward the fabrication of next-generation functional materials and devices. Here, we present a comprehensive review on the physical basis behind self-assembly and the processes reported in recent years to direct the assembly of nanoscale functional blocks into hierarchically ordered structures. This paper emphasizes assembly in the synthetic domain as well in the biological domain, underscoring the importance of biomimetic approaches toward novel materials. In particular, two important classes of directed self-assembly, namely, (i) self-assembly among nanoparticle--polymer systems and (ii) external field-guided assembly are highlighted. The spontaneous self-assembling behavior observed in nature that leads to complex, multifunctional, hierarchical structures within biological systems is also discussed in this review. Recent research undertaken to synthesize hierarchically assembled functional materials have underscored the need as well as the benefits harvested in synergistically combining top-down fabrication methods with bottom-up self-assembly.},

@article{2014-tokarev,
	Abstract = {A method for the generation of remotely reconfigurable anisotropic coatings is developed. To form these coatings, locking magnetic nanoparticles (LMNPs) made of a superparamagnetic core and a two-component polymer shell are employed. Two different polymers form phase-separated coaxial shells. The outer shell provides repulsive interactions between the LMNPs while the inner shell exerts attractive forces between the particles. Applying a non-uniform magnetic field, one gathers the particles together, pushing them to come in contact when the internal shells could effectively hold the particles together. When the magnetic field is turned off, the particles remain locked due to these strong interactions between internal shells. The shells are thus made stimuli-responsive, so this locking can be made reversible and the chains can be disintegrated on demand. In a non-uniform magnetic field, the assembled chains translocate, bind to the solid substrate and form anisotropic coatings with a ``locked'' anisotropic structure. The coatings can be constructed, aligned, realigned, degraded, and generated again on demand by changing the magnetic field and particle environment. The mechanism of the coating formation is explained using experimental observations and a theoretical model.},

	Abstract = { The self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is employed to numerically study the response of weak polybase type polymer chains grafted on a sphere to electric fields generated by the uniform positive or negative charges on the grafting substrate in the planar polyelectrolyte brush limit. Also the effect of curvature of the grafting sphere on the brush height of weak polybase brushes in the absence of surface charges is investigated. The numerical study reveals interesting and nontrivial dependence of the brush height on the radius of the grafting substrate. Consistent with experimental results, in the parameter range of the surface charge density examined, the brush height is found to be independent of the applied electric field at intermediate and high grafting densities. At relatively low grafting density, the applied negative surface charge which is termed as negative bias in this study results in a reduction of the brush height. At rather low grafting density, the positive bias corresponding to applied positive surface charges can lead to a slight increase in the brush height. The underlining mechanism governing the response of weak polybase brushes to the applied electric field is elucidated. },

A special challenge in these small micro-fluidic systems is to create good mixing flows, since it is almost impossible to generate turbulence. We propose an active micro-fluidic mixing concept inspired by nature, namely by micro-organisms that swim through a liquid by oscillating microscopic hairs, cilia, that cover their surface. We have fabricated artificial cilia consisting of electro-statically actuated polymer structures, and have integrated these in a micro-fluidic channel. Flow visualization experiments show that the cilia can generate substantial fluid velocities, up to 0.6 mm s-1. In addition, very efficient mixing is obtained using specially designed geometrical cilia configurations in a micro-channel. Since the artificial cilia can be actively controlled using electrical signals, they have exciting applications in micro-fluidic devices.},

The brush adopts ripple and dimple morphologies upon exposure to toluene and acetone, respectively. The same locations on the brush samples, adopting these two morphologies, were scanned with AFM before and after each etching step. We found that the ripple morphology consists of depressed PS-rich and elevated PMMA-rich elongated domains. In the dimple morphology, the core of the cluster is rich in PS, while the very top layer and the valleys between clusters are rich in PMMA. These experimental observations agree with self-consistent field theoretical predictions of the phase-segregated morphologies in nonselective and selective solvents. The 3D structures of the mixed brushes in dry and swollen states were reconstructed using nanotomography data.},

Sterical stabilization of MNPs in organic and water carrier liquids is discussed in details, related to the diagrams of magnetic nanofluid synthesis procedures. The macroscopic behavior, especially the magnetic and flow properties of magnetic fluids and their compatibility with various media and exploitation conditions in magnetofluidic devices are described related to composition and structural characteristics, such as nature and size of magnetic nanoparticles, nature and chain length of surfactants used for ultrastable dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles in various non-polar and polar carrier liquids, hydrodynamic size of particles, as well as the formation and characteristics of agglomerates induced by an applied magnetic field. Manifold results of structural investigations of MNFs by small angle neutron scattering (SANS), including specific techniques (contrast variation, scattering of polarized neutrons) are presented concerning particle structure (size, surfactant shell thickness, composition of core and shell, solvent rate penetration in surfactant layer, micelles), magnetic structure (magnetic size and composition), particle interaction (interparticle potential, magnetic moment correlation, phase separation) and cluster formation (aggregation and chain formation). Long-term colloidal stability of magnetic nanofluids and their properties are discussed in terms of the above structural characteristics.},

	Abstract = {A diverse range of molecular self-organization processes arises from a competition between directional and isotropic van der Waals intermolecular interactions. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations of the Stockmayer fluid (SF) with a large dipolar interaction as a minimal self-organization model and focus on basic thermodynamic properties that are needed to characterize the polymerization transition that occurs in this fluid. In particular, we determine the polymerization transition lines from the maximum in the specific heat, Cv, and the inflection point in the extent of polymerization, Φ. We also characterize the geometry (radius of gyration Rg, chain length L, chain topology) of the clusters that form in this associating fluid as a function of temperature, T, and concentration, ρ. The pressure, P, and the second virial coefficient, B2, were determined, since these properties contain essential information about the strength of the isotropic (van der Waals) interactions. Our simulations indicate that the locations of the polymerization lines are quantitatively consistent with a model of equilibrium polymerization with the enthalpy of polymerization (``sticking energy'') fixed by the minimum in the intermolecular potential. The polymerization transition in the SF is accompanied by a topological transition from predominantly linear to ring polymers upon cooling that is driven by the minimization of the dipolar energy of the clusters. We also find that the basic interaction parameters describing polymerization and phase separation in the SF can be estimated based on the existing theory of equilibrium polymerization, but the theory must be refined to account for ring formation in order to accurately describe the configurational properties of this model self-organizing fluid.},

	Abstract = {Anisotropy counts: A brief review of the main physical properties of elongated magnetic particles (EMPs) is presented. The most important characteristic of an EMP is the additional contribution of shape anisotropy to the total anisotropy energy of the particle, when compared to spherical magnetic particles. The electron micrograph shows Ni-ferrite microrods fabricated by the authors.We present an overview of the main physical properties of elongated magnetic particles (EMPs), including some of their more relevant properties in suspension. When compared to a spherical magnetic particle, the most important characteristic of an EMP is an additional contribution of shape anisotropy to the total anisotropy energy of the particle. Increasing aspect ratios also lead to an increase in both the critical single-domain size of a magnetic particle and its resistance to thermally activated spontaneous reversal of the magnetization. For single-domain EMPs, magnetization reversal occurs primarily by one of two modes, coherent rotation or curling, the latter being facilitated by larger aspect ratios. When EMPs are used to prepare colloidal suspensions, other physical properties come into play, such as their anisotropic friction coefficient and the consequent enhanced torque they experience in a shear flow, their tendency to align in the direction of an external field, to form less dense sediments and to entangle into more intricate aggregates. From a more practical point of view, EMPs are discussed in connection with two interesting types of magnetic colloids: magnetorheological fluids and suspensions for magnetic hyperthermia. Advances reported in the literature regarding the use of EMPs in these two systems are included. In the final section, we present a summary of the most relevant methods documented in the literature for the fabrication of EMPs, together with a list of the most common ferromagnetic materials that have been synthesized in the form of EMPs.},

	Abstract = {A direct method for the preparation of uniform magnetite nanoparticles with sizes around 30 nm and stable in aqueous media at pH 7 has been developed. This method is based on the precipitation of an iron (II) salt (FeSO 4 ) in the presence of a base (NaOH) and a mild oxidant (KNO 3 ). Reaction rate seems to be controlled by the iron salt concentration and the presence of ethanol in the media. Thus lower iron concentration and a water/ethanol ratio equal to one lead to the formation of the smallest particles, 30 nm in diameter. Colloidal suspensions of these particles were directly obtained by simple ultrasonic treatment of the powders leading to very stable ferrofluids at pH 7. Sulphate anions present at the particle surface seem to be responsible for the colloidal stability, providing a biocompatible character to the suspensions. The structural, morphological and magnetic characterization of the nanoparticles is also described and suggests that the smallest particles have a diameter close to the limit between monodomain--multidomain magnetic structure, which could account for the high powder absorption of magnetic fields. According to this calorimetric experiments resulted in specific power absorption rates of ca 80--95 W g −1 , which are among the highest values reported in the literature and make these nanoparticles very interesting for hyperthermia.},

In this case, the hydrodynamics is governed by the viscosity rather than inertia and special elements have to be introduced into the system for mixing and pumping of fluids. Here we report on the realization of an effective pumping device that mimics a ciliated surface and imitates its motion to generate fluid flow. The artificial biomimetic cilia are constructed as long chains of spherical superparamagnetic particles, which self-assemble in an external magnetic field. Magnetic field is also used to actuate the cilia in a simple nonreciprocal manner, resulting in a fluid flow.

In contrast to the bond-fluctuation polymer model in certain parameter ranges, where these two conformational transitions were found to merge in the thermodynamic limit, we conclude from our results that the two transitions remain well separated in the limit of infinite chain lengths. The reason for this qualitatively distinct behavior is presumably due to the ultrashort attractive interaction range in the lattice models considered here.},

	Abstract = {We describe an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm using a random walk in energy space to obtain a very accurate estimate of the density of states for classical statistical models. The density of states is modified at each step when the energy level is visited to produce a flat histogram. By carefully controlling the modification factor, we allow the density of states to converge to the true value very quickly, even for large systems. From the density of states at the end of the random walk, we can estimate thermodynamic quantities such as internal energy and specific heat capacity by calculating canonical averages at any temperature. Using this method, we not only can avoid repeating simulations at multiple temperatures, but we can also estimate the free energy and entropy, quantities that are not directly accessible by conventional Monte Carlo simulations. This algorithm is especially useful for complex systems with a rough landscape since all possible energy levels are visited with the same probability. As with the multicanonical Monte Carlo technique, our method overcomes the tunneling barrier between coexisting phases at first-order phase transitions. In this paper, we apply our algorithm to both first- and second-order phase transitions to demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy. We obtained direct simulational estimates for the density of states for two-dimensional ten-state Potts models on lattices up to 200×200 and Ising models on lattices up to 256×256. Our simulational results are compared to both exact solutions and existing numerical data obtained using other methods. Applying this approach to a three-dimensional $\pm$J spin-glass model, we estimate the internal energy and entropy at zero temperature; and, using a two-dimensional random walk in energy and order-parameter space, we obtain the (rough) canonical distribution and energy landscape in order-parameter space. Preliminary data suggest that the glass transition temperature is about 1.2 and that better estimates can be obtained with more extensive application of the method. This simulational method is not restricted to energy space and can be used to calculate the density of states for any parameter by a random walk in the corresponding space.},

On the basis of experimental observation, we supposed that magnetite NPs may first assemble into chains by magnetic dipole−dipole interactions.

So, the stability of chains may determine the yield, size, and morphologies of necklace-like nanorings.},

Functionalized with DNA with single-stranded sticky ends, patches on different particles can form highly directional bonds through programmable, specific and reversible DNA hybridization. These features allow the particles to self-assemble into `colloidal molecules' with triangular, tetrahedral and other bonding symmetries, and should also give access to a rich variety of new microstructured colloidal materials.},

The interesting properties of ferrogels originate from a complex interplay of the mechanical properties of the polymers with the magnetic interactions of the embedded nanoparticles. The ability to control the system by an external magnetic field may give rise to applications in medicine and engineering. In this paper{,} we propose and examine two microscopical simulation models for a 2D ferrogel which are suited to explain two distinct mechanisms of deformation in such a system. The first model focusses on deformation of the gel due to the dipole-dipole interaction between the magnetic nanoparticles. In an external magnetic field{,} a gel of this kind elongates in the direction parallel to the field and shrinks in the perpendicular direction. The second model deals with a distortion of the polymer matrix due to the transmission of torques from the magnetic nanoparticles to the polymer network. In this model{,} we observe an isotropic shrinking of the gel in an external magnetic field. As the observed deformations are very different in the two models{,} we conclude that the magnetoelastic behaviour of a magnetic gel strongly depends on the microscopical details of{,} both{,} the structure of the network and the coupling between the polymers and the magnetic nanoparticles.

	Abstract = {Abstract Ferrogels, i.e., magnetic nanoparticles immersed into a swollen polymer gel, are materials which combine the magnetic properties of a ferrofluid with the elastic properties of a hydrogel. This makes it possible to control their shape and elasticity by means of external magnetic fields. Magnetic gels are therefore considered for medical and technical applications such as actuation and drug delivery systems. In this paper, we focus on a special class of magnetic gels in which the magnetic nanoparticles act as the cross-linkers of the polymer network. Experimentally this is achieved by functionalizing the nanoparticles' surface such that the polymers can covalently bind to it. In this way, a coupling between the orientation of the nanoparticles and the polymer matrix is created. When an external magnetic field is applied to such a system, the magnetic particles align to the field, and due to the coupling between the nanoparticles' orientation and the gel matrix, a strain is exerted on the polymers. This leads to a shrinking of the gel as a whole. In this paper, we explain how to extend a two-dimensional simulation model for such a system (Soft Matter 8 (2012) 9923 [18]) to three dimensions. We will show that, while an isotropic deformation was observed in the two-dimensional case, in three dimensions the gel shrinks anisotropically. This is due to the fact that orientational fluctuations of the nanoparticles are hindered in the direction perpendicular to an external magnetic field. },

We thoroughly investigate the origin of this phenomenon through analyzing first the ground states of the SD-particle systems as a function of an applied field. In a second step we quantify the microstructure of these systems as functions of the shift parameter, the effective interaction parameter, and the applied magnetic field strength. We conclude the paper by showing that with the proper choice of parameters, it is possible to create a system of SD-particles with highly interacting magnetic particles, whose initial susceptibility is below the Langevin susceptibility, and which remains spatially isotropic even in a very strong external magnetic field.},

Surface-grafted polyelectrolyte brushes exhibit rich responsive behavior and show great promise as ``smart surfaces'', but existing switching methods involve physically or chemically changing the solution in contact with the brush. In this study, high grafting density poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) brushes were grown from silicon surfaces using atom transfer radical polymerization. Optical ellipsometry and neutron reflectivity were used to measure changes in the profiles of the brushes in response to DC voltages applied between the brush substrate and a parallel electrode some distance away in the surrounding liquid (water or D2O). Positive voltages were shown to cause swelling, while negative voltages in some cases caused deswelling. Neutron reflectometry experiments were carried out on the INTER reflectometer (ISIS, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK) allowing time-resolved measurements of polymer brush structure. The PDMAEMA brushes were shown to have a polymer volume fraction profile described by a Gaussian-terminated parabola both in the equilibrium and in the partially swollen states. At very high positive voltages (in this study, positive bias means positive voltage to the brush-bearing substrate), the brush chains were shown to be stretched to an extent comparable to their contour length, before being physically removed from the interface. Voltage-induced swelling was shown to exhibit a wider range of brush swelling states in comparison to pH switching, with the additional advantages that the stimulus is remotely controlled and may be fully automated.},

Representative examples include colloidal particles at an interface, electrorheological fluids, magnetic thin films, nanocrystals deposited on a substrate etc. Methodological aspects related to the long range of the dipolar interaction and its directional nature (energy calculation, cluster moves) are summarized. Taking as an example a bilayer of dipolar hard spheres, we demonstrate that the energy and structural properties of a thin slab of dipolar particles periodic in two dimensions and finite in the third can be accurately calculated by means of the usual three-dimensional Ewald sum. Some new simulation results for the structural properties of Q2D dipolar hard spheres with additional attraction, in an external field or in bilayers, are presented.},

	Abstract = {A new formulation of statistical thermodynamics is derived for classical fluids of molecules that tend to associate into dimers and possibly highers-mers due to highly directional attraction. A breakup of the pair potential into repulsive and highly directionally attractive parts is introduced into the expansion of the logarithm of the grand partition function in fugacity graphs. The bonding by the directional attraction is used to classify the graphs and to introduce a topological reduction which results in the replacement of the fugacity by two variables: singlet densityρ and monomer densityρ 0. Results for the thermodynamic functions as functionals ofρ andρ 0 are given in the form of graph sums. Pair correlations are analyzed in terms of a new matrix analog of the direct correlation function. It is shown that the low-density limit is treated exactly, while major difficulties arise when the Mayer expansion, which employs onlyp, is used. The intricate resummations required for the Mayer expansion are illustrated for the case where dimers are the only association products.},

The system treated is one where repulsion and highly directional attraction due to a single molecular site combine to allow the formation of dimers, but no highers-mers. We derive thermodynamic perturbation theory, using the system interacting with only the repulsive potential as a reference system. Two distinct integral equations for the pair correlation are derived. The first one treats both parts of the interaction approximately; the other one employs the repulsive reference system used in perturbation theory. We show that each of these integral equations permits the calculation of an important thermodynamic function directly from the solution at a single state of density and temperature. In the first case this applies to a pressure consistent with the compressibility relation, in the second to the excess Helmholtz free energy over the reference system.},

We explore the relationship between graph cancelation in the fugacity expansion and three types of steric incompatibility between repulsive and attractive interactions involving several molecules. The steric effects are used to best advantage in a limited regrouping of bonds. This controls the density parameters which appear when articulation points are eliminated in the graphical representation. Each density parameter is a singlet density for a species consisting of molecules with a specified set of sites bonded. The densities satisfy subsidiary conditions of internal consistency. These conditions are equivalent to a minimization of the Helmholtz free energyA. Graphical expressions forA and for the pressurep are derived.

	Abstract = {We derive several extensions of a previously given first‐order perturbation theory (TPT 1) for fluids in which chain and ring polymers can be formed, due to the presence of two singly bondable molecular attraction sites. We retain graphs which contain a single chain of attraction bonds, and evaluate second‐order perturbation theory (TPT 2) within this framework. The previous formulation with sites fixed in the molecule is generalized to allow movable sites, thus permitting calculations for flexible bead polymers. The TPT 1 result for the equation of state of an equilibrium mixture of chain lengths is in good agreement with simulations of flexible bead polymers of fixed bead number N, when the mean number ν of beads is equated to the fixed N of the simulations. TPT 2 differs from TPT 1 by a rather small term, with improved agreement. If the distribution of movable sites includes configurations such that bonding of one site blocks bonding of the other, then graph resummation must be used. Resummed TPT yield physically reasonable results over the entire range of conditions. For total blockage, where only dimers can be formed, resummed TPT reduces to a successful version of TPT given earlier for dimerizing systems. The equation of state appears in the form of two parametric equations. The first one gives the excess pressure over the reference system in terms of ν and the number density ρ̄ of beads. In TPT 1 this equation is universal for hard spheres with or without dimerization or chain polymerization. The second equation is nonuniversal and contains the dependence of ν on ρ̄, the strength of the bonding attraction, the number of sites, and the amount of blockage in the case of two sites. An additional simulational test of TPT 2 is suggested.},

A full 3D characterization of the mesocrystals was performed using image analysis{,} high-resolution scanning electron microscopy and Grazing Incidence Small Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS). This enabled the structural determination of e.g. multi-domain mesocrystals with complex crystal habits and the quantification of interparticle distances with sub-nm precision. Mesocrystals of small nanocubes (l = 8.6-12.6 nm) are isostructural with a body centred tetragonal (bct) lattice whereas assemblies of the largest nanocubes in this study (l = 13.6 nm) additionally form a simple cubic (sc) lattice. The mesocrystal habit can be tuned from a square{,} hexagonal to star-like and pillar shapes depending on the particle size and shape and the strength of the applied magnetic field.

	Abstract = {The dynamics of ordering and relaxation processes in magnetic colloids has been studied by means of stroboscopic small angle neutron scattering techniques in an oscillating magnetic field. Surfactant stabilized ferrofluids (FFs) of Fe3O4 and Co nanoparticles have been investigated as a function of temperature and frequency and compared to a solid Cu alloy with 0.8vol Co precipitates. This technique allowed elucidating the dynamical nature of the locally ordered domains in both ferrofluids as ``living objects'' becoming arrested below the freezing temperature of the solvent. The time-dependent intensities have been analyzed in terms of Langevin statistics including dynamical interparticle structure factors, which scale with the square of the Langevin function. The local ordering is mainly determined by the effective dipole-dipole interaction, which is enhanced by the partial alignment of the particle moments in an external magnetic field. Starting from the frozen state, the amount of freely rotating particle moments increases continuously with increasing temperature. The dynamical structure factors describing the hexagonal (Fe3O4-FF) or chainlike (Co-FF) ordering reach a maximum around the melting temperature. The alignment of particle moments along the applied field is governed by the fast Brownian rotation of individual nanoparticles and small aggregates, while the magnetic relaxation of longer dipolar chains and local hexagonal domains is much slower. In contrast, no field-induced interparticle correlations occur in the diluted solid CuCo alloy where the moment relaxation is purely of fast N{\'e}el type, which-due to a low anisotropy constant-follows the oscillating field at all temperatures.},

These magnetite nanoparticles exhibited almost standard cube-like shape and were coated with a thick PVP layer (∼8 nm) to form a magnetite−PVP core−shell structure. Driven by strong magnetic dipolar attractions, magnetite nanocubes could be assembled into flux-closure rings, which consisted of several to dozens of nanocubes. The rings had one-particle annular thickness, and individual nanocubes were spaced fully together. It was found that only nanocubes, the average size of which was close to 50 nm, could be assembled into rings, while slightly smaller particles were aligned in dipolar chains, suggesting that ring self-assembly could be produced by the degradation of dipolar chains that were a metastable structure with respect to rings, and only larger nanocubes with strong magnetic dipoles could overcome the potential barrier for the transformation from chains to rings.},

	Abstract = {A method is proposed for simulating the dynamic behavior of rigid and flexible fibers in a flow field. The fiber is regarded as made up of spheres that are lined up and bonded to each neighbor. Each pair of bonded spheres can stretch, bend, and twist, by changing bond distance, bond angle, and torsion angle between spheres, respectively. The strength of bonding, or flexibility of the fiber model, is defined by three parameters of stretching, bending, and twisting constants. By altering these parameters, the property of the fiber model can be changed to be rigid to flexible. The motion of the fiber model in a flow field is determined by solving the translational and rotational equations for individual spheres under the hydrodynamic force and torque exerting on. This method was applied to simulate rotational motions with and without bending deformation of the fiber in a simple shear flow under the conditions of infinitely dilute system, no hydrodynamic interaction and low Reynolds number of a particle. For the rigid fiber, the computed period of rotation and the computed distribution of orientation angle agree with those calculated by Jeffery's equation with an equivalent ellipsoidal aspect ratio. For the flexible fiber, the period of rotation decreases rapidly with the growth of bending deformation of the fiber and rotation orbits deviate from a circular one of the rigid fiber. These tendencies are similar to experimental ones described by Forgacs and Mason. These results show that the proposed method using bonded spheres' model can reproduce the dynamic behavior of rigid and flexible fibers in a flow field successfully},

Finally{,} we will outline future perspectives for these colloidal suprastructures.},

	Abstract = {Superparamagnetic beads and nonmagnetic beads of different sizes were assembled to form a &#8220;ring-structure&#8221; in a magnetorheological (MR) fluid solution by the application of external magnetic fields. For superparamagnetic beads and non-magnetic beads functionalized with probe and target molecules, respectively, the ring-structure was maintained even after removing the external magnetic field due to biomolecular bonding. Several experiments are described, including the formation process of ring-structures with and without molecular interactions, the accelerating effect of external magnetic fields, and the effect of biotin concentration on the structures of the rings. We define the small nonmagnetic particles as &#8220;petals&#8221; because the whole structure looks like a flower. The number of remnant ring petals was a function of the concentration of target molecules in the concentration range of 0.0768 ng/ml&#8764;3.8419 ng/ml which makes this protocol a promising method for biosensing. Not only was the formation process rapid, but the resulting two-dimensional colloidal system also offers a simple method for reducing reagent consumption and waste generation.},

	Abstract = {The effects of applied magnetic field on the system composed of polymer brushes and magnetic particles are studied by means of Monte Carlo simulation. The direction of the applied magnetic field is chosen to be perpendicular to the substrate plane. Polymer brushes and magnetic particles are attracted to each other. The average heights of polymer brushes depend not only on the strength of applied magnetic field (H) but also on the brush grafting density (σ) and the chain length (N). The applied magnetic field influences the arrangement of magnetic particles, and in turn, the arrangement of magnetic particles affects the spatial distribution of polymer brush monomers. When the strength of the magnetic field is increased, the average height of polymer brushes will be increased accordingly. The reason is that the orientations of the magnetic moments of particles must be along the magnetic field direction, and this leads polymer brushes to rearrange along the magnetic field direction. At the same time, the chain length and the grafting density of polymer brushes have also effects on the properties of the magnetic particles, such as the magnetic particles distribution, magnetic susceptibility, and pair correlation functions. Comparisons with the experimental ones are also made, and this investigation can provide some insights into statistical properties of magnetic particle-loaded brushes induced by external magnetic field.},

With increasing system size, the structural motif evolves from chains and rings to multi-chain and multi-ring assemblies. Very large systems form single- and multi-wall coils, tubes and scrolls. These structural changes result from a competition between various energy terms, which can be approximated analytically within a continuum model. We also study the effect of external parameters such as magnetic field on the relative stability of these structures. Our results may give insight into experimental data obtained during solidification of ferrofluid aggregates at temperatures where thermal fluctuations become negligible in comparison to inter-particle interactions.

	Abstract = {The effects of an applied magnetic field on the system composed of polyelectrolytes (PEs) and magnetic nanoparticles oppositely charged are studied by means of Monte Carlo method within the framework of "single-site bond fluctuation model." For a certain concentration of chains, the coil-globule transition can be induced by the applied magnetic field. The mean-square end-to-end distance and gyration radius as well as the shape factor of PE chains are used to characterize the conformational transitions. The statistical analysis of the system energy demonstrates this significant physical process. The role of entropy-energy balance is well-understood for different chain lengths, and a typical phase-transition anomaly concerned with specific heat curve is observed. Under a certain magnetic field, the PE chains will regularly collapse due to the enough adsorption of magnetic particles. The magnetic particles exhibit peculiar spatial distribution at high magnetic fields: the string-like arrangement along the magnetic field and the square lattice-like arrangement perpendicular to the magnetic field. The applied magnetic field has a great influence on the length of string-like structures formed by nanoparticles. This investigation may cast light on the collapse of PEs and provide a promising method for producing new nanocomposites.},

The tile-based approach is an older method that provides a good tool to construct small and simple structures, usually with multiply repeated domains.

	Abstract = {Concentrated solutions of duplex-forming DNA oligomers organize into various mesophases among which is the nematic (N∗), which exhibits a macroscopic chiral helical precession of molecular orientation because of the chirality of the DNA molecule. Using a quantitative analysis of the transmission spectra in polarized optical microscopy, we have determined the handedness and pitch of this chiral nematic helix for a large number of sequences ranging from 8 to 20 bases. The B-DNA molecule exhibits a right-handed molecular double-helix structure that, for long molecules, always yields N∗ phases with left-handed pitch in the μm range. We report here that ultrashort oligomeric duplexes show an extremely diverse behavior, with both left- and right-handed N∗ helices and pitches ranging from macroscopic down to 0.3 μm. The behavior depends on the length and the sequence of the oligomers, and on the nature of the end-to-end interactions between helices. In particular, the N∗ handedness strongly correlates with the oligomer length and concentration. Right-handed phases are found only for oligomers shorter than 14 base pairs, and for the sequences having the transition to the N∗ phase at concentration larger than 620 mg/mL. Our findings indicate that in short DNA, the intermolecular double-helical interactions switch the preferred liquid crystal handedness when the columns of stacked duplexes are forced at high concentrations to separations comparable to the DNA double-helix pitch, a regime still to be theoretically described.},

	Abstract = {Fabricating new functional materials has always been at the center of colloidal science, and how to form circular rings is a meaningful challenge due to their special electronic, magnetic and optical properties. Magnetic colloidal spheres can self-assemble into rings, but these rings have an uncontrollable length and shape and also have to coexist with chains and defected clusters. To make the most of magnetic spheres being able to self-assemble into rings, a patch is added to the surface of the sphere to form a chiral link between particles. The structural transition in the system of patchy magnetic spheres is studied using the Monte Carlo simulation. When the patch angle is in the interval ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/28/14/145101/cmaa184cieqn001.gif] {${{60}^{{}^\circ}}$} to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/28/14/145101/cmaa184cieqn002.gif] {${{75}^{{}^\circ}}$} , rings become the dominant structure if the strength of patchy interaction exceeds a particular threshold and the shape of these rings is close to the circle. With an increase in the patch angle, the threshold of patchy interaction decreases and the average length of the circular ring increases approximately from 5 to 8.5.},

	Abstract = {In this Perspective, we present a unique approach to the design and synthesis of giant molecules based on ``nanoatoms'' for engineering structures across multiple length scales and controlling their macroscopic properties. Herein, "nanoatoms" refer to shape-persistent molecular nanoparticles (MNPs) with precisely defined chemical structures and surface functionalities that can serve as elemental building blocks for the precision synthesis of giant molecules by methods such as sequential ``click'' approach. Typical ``nanoatoms'' include those MNPs based on fullerenes, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes, polyoxometalates, and folded globular proteins. The resulting giant molecules are precisely defined macromolecules. They include, but are not limited to, giant surfactants, giant shape amphiphiles, and giant polyhedra. Giant surfactants are polymer tail-tethered ``nanoatoms'' where the two components have drastic chemical differences to impart amphiphilicity. Giant shape amphiphiles not only are built up by covalently bonded MNPs of distinct shapes where the self-assembly is driven by chemical interactions but also are largely influenced by the packing constraints of each individual shape. Giant polyhedra are either made of a large MNP or by deliberately placing ``nanoatoms'' at the vertices of a polyhedron. In general, giant molecules capture the essential structural features of their small-molecule counterparts in many ways but possess much larger sizes. They are recognized in certain cases as size-amplified versions of those counterparts, and often, they bridge the gap between small molecules and traditional macromolecules. Highly diverse, thermodynamically stable and metastable hierarchal structures are commonly observed in the bulk, thin film, and solution states of these giant molecules. Controlled structural variations by precision synthesis further reveal a remarkable sensitivity of their self-assembled structures to the primary chemical structures. Unconventional nanostructures can be obtained in confined environments or through directed self-assembly. All the results demonstrate that MNPs are unique elements for macromolecular science, providing a versatile platform for engineering nanostructures that are not only scientifically intriguing but also technologically relevant.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the electroactuation of microcantilevers coated on one side with cationic polyelectrolyte brushes. We observed very strong cantilever deflection by alternating the potential on the cantilever between +0.5 and -0.5 V at frequencies up to 0.25 Hz. The actuation resulted from significant increases in the expansive stresses in the polymer brush layer at both negative and positive potentials. However, the deflection at negative bias was significantly larger. We have developed a theoretical framework that correlates conformational changes of the polymer chains in the brush layer with the reorganization of ions due to the potential bias. The model predicts a strong increase in the polymer volume fraction, close to the interface, which results in large expansive stresses that bend the cantilever at negative potentials. The model also predicts that the actuation responds much stronger to negative potentials than positive potentials, as observed in the experiments.},

The simplest model of the system, taking these chains as rod-like aggregates, where thermal fluctuations of the shape of these chains are ignored is considered. The boundaries of validity of this model are estimated and it is shown that - as a first approximation - it can be used for many real ferrofluids. The influence of the chains on magnetization and rheological properties of ferrofluids is evaluated. The analysis shows, that these aggregates induce physical phenomena which are impossible in magnetic liquids with separate particles and which are thus not described by the classical models for ferrofluids.},

@book{2014-wereley,
	Abstract = {Magnetorheological fluids, smart fluids which change viscosity in the presence of a magnetic field, are of great commercial interest for many engineering applications such as shock absorbers and dampers in aerospace.

Magnetorheology: Advances and Applications provides an update on the key developments in the physics, chemistry and uses of magnetorheological fluids. Topics covered include the role of interparticle friction and rotational diffusion, magnetoelasticity, nondimensional flow analysis, thin-film rheology, tribology, coated magnetorheological composite particles and magnetorheological devices with multiple functions. Specific chapters on applications cover adaptive magnetorheological energy absorbing mounts for shock mitigation, magnetorheological fluid-based high precision finishing technologies, adaptive magnetorheological landing gear systems and magnetorheological lag dampers for stability augmentation in helicopters.

Edited by a leading expert and with contributions from distinguished scientists in the field this timely book is suitable for chemists, physicists and engineers wanting to gain a comprehensive overview of these smart materials.},
